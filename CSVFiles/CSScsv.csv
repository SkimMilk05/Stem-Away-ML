1,Finished tea cozy project,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,1,"
I have finished the tea cozy project and want to know how I could improve it. I have notice that when I press the nav links it doesn’t show all of the contents in the specific containers, is there a way to fix this? I am also not completely understanding the media query part. Can anyone help?

2,Fake Company Project,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",2,"
Hello , can somebody help me out here with the advice where to look for the solution. I know something is not right with my flexbox, but can’t see the problem or where i have to correct. If i resize the screen my 3 images from the container get out and overflow other contents.
This is the CSS part:
.team {
height: 500px;

display: flex;

background-image: url(""..//image//business2.jpg"");

background-size: cover;

background-position: center;

background-repeat: no-repeat;

justify-content: center;

flex-wrap: wrap;

text-align: center;

align-content: center;   

}
#team-container h2 {
text-align: center;

font-size: 2rem;

font-family: ""Lexend Mega"" , sans-serif;

}
.teammate{
display: block;

flex-basis: 280px; 

flex-shrink: 1;

}
.teammate img {
width: 200px;

height: 250px;

align-items: center;

}
And this is the HTML:

    <h2>Our Team</h2>

    <div class=""team"">

        <div class=""teammate"">

            <img src="".\\resources\\image\\employee1.jpg"">

            <h3>Lisa Fischer</h3>

            <p>C.E.O. - Founder and Principal Investor</p>

        </div>

        <div class=""teammate"">

            <img src="".\\resources\\image\\employee2.jpg"">

            <h3>Alex Lasker</h3>

            <p>Partner - Research & Development</p>

        </div>

        <div class=""teammate"">

            <img src="".\\resources\\image\\employee3.jpg"">

            <h3>Omar Carlsen</h3>

            <p>Partner - Partnerships & Marketing</p>

        </div>

    </div>

 </div>

Of course this is not all but the relevant part! Shed a little light on me please. Thank you

I found a solution ,just now 
I added in the .team selector a min-height instead of height and also put a top padding so it looks nicer.
But I am still curious what other solutions are there, and how messy is my code. Thank You!

3,"Can't find ""Computed"" tab in the Google Chrome DevTools box-model dimension to view and edit","Get Help,CSS",box-model,5,"
Hello,
I am not seeing the “computed” tab in the Google Chrome Devtool’s box-model dimension to view and edit.
When I use right-click inspect to open up the DevTools, I don’t see the “computed” tab.

What version of Chrome do you have?
I found this at SO:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55199167/why-does-chrome-dev-tools-not-show-computed-tab
I think you have to change the panel layout in dev tools–preferences (the little ellipses at top right)

on the second screenshot that I posted above (you’re in dev tools), click on the vertical ellipses, “Customize and control dev tools.” which is in the upper right corner, next to the gear.
then, click on ""more tools > settings>>panel layout then select “vertical.” the default is “auto” i think.

4,Responsive images,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
a bit confused here…
i have found multiple instructions for responsive images
from codecademy
.container {
width: 50%;
height: 200px;
overflow: hidden;
}
.container img {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
display: block;
}
a media query using min-width and max-width
or
<img src=“sample.jpg” width=“100” height=“200”
or
img {width: 100%; max-width 100%; height : auto;
}
i know that last one is similar to the first, but coded differently
ultimately i am after the best way to code images responsively
any thing and everything is welcome!
many thanks!
","
Hi,
The best way is often defined by context (hence, all the different ways  ).
The media queries will basically let you target how your image should look in different devices (you can use the browser tools to simulate what phones and tables see… access with right-click, inspect-element, and find the phone button).
Setting a percentage width is useful but there are some contexts where you wouldn’t use it (again, depending on what you’re doing).
The best way to get a good sense of how they are useful is by trying to make sample websites and try really strictly to get a layout you want in each mode (desktop, tablet, tablet-rotated, mobile, mobile-rotated).

5,The first/last/only/nth-child selector,"Get Help,CSS",general,3,"
Trying to understand the role of the space between an element and the colon that’s part of the pseudo-selector.
p: first-child
Selects all p elements that are the first child of some parent element.
p:first-child
Selects all first child elements that are nested under p.
Two questions:

Is that correct?
Does that apply to all the pseudo-selectors (first/last/only/nth)

","
Hey there @roisql 



 roisql:

Is that correct?


Not entirely, but your close.
p:first-child selects every <p> element that is the first child nested under it’s parent element:
p:first-child {
  color: green
}

<div>
  <p> I will be green, I am the first child </p>
  <p> I won't be green, I am not the first child </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p> I will also be green, I am the first child of MY parent </p>
  <p> I am not the first child of my parent </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h1> Not green. Though I am a first child I am not a p element </h1>
  <p> I will not be green, I am not the first child </p>
<div>





 roisql:

p: first-child


I am guessing you meant p :first-child 
I don’t believe p: first-child is a valid selector.
If you have the selector p :first-child, than the first child of every <p> element will be selected:
<p> This text is not selected 
  <span> Though this is </span> 
  <span> yet this is not </span>
</p>


Not all pseudo selectors work exactly like this, for example p :hover does nothing.
However if you combine multiple selectors you can get some interesting results.
For example:
p :first-child:hover {
  color: green;
}

This will make the first child of every <p> element turn green when it is hovered over.
I would say the best way to learn about them is to experiment with them your self.

Thank you! That was very helpful.

6,Help with Grid positioning,"Get Help,CSS",learn-grid,1,"
Hi guys, just wondering if anyone knows where I am going wrong. I was trying to practise grid positioning with my own exercise (I am currently finishing Learn CSS), but cannot find an answer to my problem. I am looking to position a piece of text on different parts of a grid that I have constructed, but it won’t move from the top left hand corner of my ‘main’ area. I have included the code and the output. Any help would be great. Thanks. Grids31680×1050 97.7 KB

You can try making the image the background of a tag and then you can control elements on top of it.
Or use an image editor (but then you lose responsiveness in smaller screens, unless you make x images for every x type of view you need).

I wonder if the path for the url is supposed to be url(""path.jpg"") instead of url(path.jpg)

I tried that it didn’t work.

Try images/mission-background.jpg without the two dots in front and the forward slash.

I finally got it. It wasn’t appearing because it had to many periods. I think you only use two periods if the css is in a separate folder from the rest of the project.

Welcome to internet explorer.
IE has a lot of things that it’s not compatible with so you have to check what you’re using against a list of IE compatibility if you want your website to be accessible from IE.
There are even ways to filter CSS if the browser is using IE.
You should probably search discussions for more info on this, one link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10122296/making-a-webpage-cross-browser-compatible

There is a code snippet: https://codepen.io/danamaria5/pen/gOPZRPa .
Here the “container” class selector in css should select both sections “home-hero” & “home-about-textbox”. As you can see in the code snippet, the colors apply just to the home-hero although the background of the home-about-textbox becomes coral in the pc media query. I can’t figure out why is still black in the mobile format.
And the font-weight is applied just to the home-about-textbox. In home-hero, font weight property should be applied just to the bolder top part of the title as the lower one is selected with the .title span which is more specific than the .container. However, this is not the case because the “Making things looks great” text is still bold instead of font-weight: 100; from the container which is selected at the end of the style sheet so nothing else overrides it. Could someone, please explain?
","
Hi! I figured out that .home-about-textbox overrides .container and I don’t know why. When I delete the color from .home-about-textbox the section becomes coral as the .home-hero.
I tried to keep the black color in the .home-about-textbox and override it with coral within .container div but what happens is that  home-about-textbox becomes coral and the home-hero it’s not coral anymore even though the class is also selected with <div class=""container""> in html.
I don’t understand why the code is not working as it should be.

Hi,
I outlined the html classes you’re talking about. Remember that the innermost elements always take precedence when you’re defining them in CSS. Anything you assign to home-about-textbox will take precedence over container.
<section class=""home-hero"">
</section>

<div class=""container"">
         <div class=""home-about-textbox""> </div>  
</div>


Additionally, note that you’ve referred to the .container class three times in the CSS (it’s not within in the scope of media queries the way you have it layed out). For one, consider making it just one declaration (under the DRY principle, don’t repeat yourself). It’s not necessary, but makes for easier control for yourself and others.
Regardless, when the situation is like this, the interpreter I think takes the last instance of a declaration and gives precedence to that one. So you’re bottom-most .container in the CSS file has the most power.
// first time
.container {
  width: 95%;
  max-width: 70em;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
// 2nd time

.container {
  width: 95%;
  max-width: 70em;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: mediumvioletred;
  color: magenta;
}
//3rd time

.container {
  width: 95%;
  max-width: 70em;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: coral;  
font-weight: 100;
color: blue;
}

11,CSS Grid Fractions,"Get Help,CSS","learn-grid,general",2,"
I am on page 6/15 of the grid class, and I am trying to learn fractions.
I have been tasked to create columns within a box, the width of which is 400px.
The Question: Change the grid so the middle column is still 50% of the grid, but the first column takes up three fourths of the remaining space and the last column takes up one fourth.
The academy says that the solution is this (and that all fractions must add to four):
 grid-template: 3fr 50% 1fr;
But, I got the same result when I wrote the following: grid-template: 0.75fr 2fr 0.25fr;
Am I wrong in some other way? I came up with my solution by thinking that half of 400px must go the middle, so we must split the grid by 2fr (in half). What’s left is 200px that I can work with; 1/4 (0.25fr) of that can go to the right; 3/4 (o.75fr)to the keft
","
Hello!



 dinnosam:

What’s left is 200px that I can work with; 1/4 (0.25fr) of that can go to the right; 3/4 (o.75fr)to the keft


While I think this will work in all cases, for the sake of readability, have whole numbers on fractions is the best way to do it. (You can do it any way, as long as all of the fr add up to the amount you need-you could also do 9fr 50% 3fr, but it wouldn’t be as readable).
I hope this helps!

i learned once i have basic styles for all devices in a style sheet, i understand i need to add styles specific to smallest screens. i read i should put them below my style  for all devices but
NOT INSIDE A MEDIA QUERY
here i am lost.
kindly explain: i should put them below my style  for all devices but
NOT INSIDE A MEDIA QUERY
I get These styles will be over written by the styles in the media query
I understand whatever styles come last  will take precedence over styles that come  before
maybe give an example to help me?
anything you can do to help is appreciated!!!
","
To the best of the knowledge that is not possible.
For example, in this instance, the <p> elements will be green regardless of the size of the browser:
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}

p {
  color: green;
}

However if you reverse it:
p {
  color: green;
}

@media (max-width: 500px) {
  color: red;
}

Than the <p> element will only be green if the media query evaluates to false.
Perhaps I am missing something here. Did you read this in a lesson?

I just completed that lesson and didn’t notice any text saying not inside a media query.
For example in this lesson, there’s a step saying:

At the bottom of  style.css , write a media query for a  max-width  of  480px .
This will allow us to shrink the width of the  .page-title  element on smaller screens.

None of the other exercises explicitly mention to add it at the bottom.

/* portofolio
=================== */

Here, the  home-about-textbox  is defined in three different ways with the class attribute :
  `<div class=""container"">
  <section class=""home-about""> for pc media
<div class=""home-about-textbox"">`for mobile media

But the container also selects the “home-hero” section:  <section class=""home-hero""> <div class=""contaier""> .
I tried to figure out what is the role of the container. When I select the  .container  in the css style sheet just the “home-about-textbox” becomes blue on the browser so I tried to change color of the container to see if this class truly selects both of the sections( “home-hero” & “home-about-textbox”) how it seems to be.
I selected the container again at the end of the code to make sure that nothing else overrides it (the last media declaration is closed) and I styled with crazy colors but nothing change. I even tried !important rule and the style is the same. My question is:
What exactly this container class selects in the code and why I can’t style it?
","
For starters there is a typo on line 25:



 system7965854827:

<div class=""contaier"">


Which is why your styling for this section is not working.

As for the home-about and home-about-textbox:
I believe the reason the the styling does not apply to them, is because the <div class=""div""> has no visable elements that are part of it. For example it contains no text, and only its grandchildren do.
As such, using something like:
.container {
  color: red;
}

does not do anything because there is nothing to style red.
However if you are more specific, such as with:
.container p{
  color: red;
}

You will select all <p> elements inside of elements with class=""container"", and the text becomes red.


I believe the reason the the styling does not apply to them, is because the <div class=""div""> has no visable elements that are part of it. For example it contains no text, and only its grandchildren do.

If you set the size for the div and set a background color with an explicit width and height it will show even if the div is empty.
@8-bit-gaming I say this because I like playing with the empty boxes  

Hello! Also have a look at the media query. It looks like it might be missing something. Here’s an article on media queries.

The typo was a big part of the problem , thank you. But now I got into the situation where the container applies the colors just to the  home-hero and the font-weight just to the home-about. Please, have a look here, where I also added a code snippet : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62996004/container-applies-properties-preferentially-to-sections .

14,2 Errors in practice session for content-box vs border-box?,"Get Help,CSS","box-model,quiz",1,"
Hey guys,
I think there are some errors in some of the questions for the practice sessions for the css box model – see screenshot (note: I had to stitch them into one image since I am only allowed to upload 1 image).
Bildschirmfoto-2020-07-17-um-18.01.26982×1120 128 KB

First possible Error

I am asked to create a box that will render with 200px width. The width itself of the box is fixed and I can only choose border-box or content-box for the box-sizing. Now I would say in that case you need to choose content-box because only than the padding (20px all sides = 40px) and border (10px all sides = 20px) will enlarge the box so that it becomes 200px. But my answer is marked wrong ?! Border-box will not get me to a 200px width box though. It will stay at 140px.

Second possible error

Here the first answer is registered as being correct. But aren’t all answers wrong? It should read “The total height and width of the box will be increased by 30px (NOT 15px!) for declaring a 15px padding”. Padding gets applied to all sides, so the box size increases by double the padding size.
Cheers,
Johannes

15,Floated elements must have width specified?,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
It says:

Floated elements must have a width specified, as in the example above. Otherwise, the element will assume the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.

I added a float property, and indeed it changed the page from this:
image648×639 17.5 KB
to this:

But inside the stylesheet, width of the corresponding classes isn’t specified.
What am I missing?

In CSS it’s always better to be explicit if you want fixed or proportional sizes. Otherwise, there’s all sorts of modifications that make sizes responsive.
The MDN documentation puts it very well:

when an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document (though still remaining part of it). It is shifted to the left, or right, until it touches the edge of its containing box, or another floated element .
…
A floated element is at least as tall as it’s tallest nested floated children. We gave the parent width: 100% and floated it to ensure it is tall enough to encompass it’s floated children, and to make sure it takes up the width of the parent so we don’t have to clear it’s adjacent sibling.

Notice how they say “A floated element is at least as tall as it’s tallest nested floated children”. Which means that without explicit dimensions its going to take certain actions.



MDN Web Docs



float
The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.

Hi, I am on the typography part of the module. I am attempting to implement the CroissantOne-Regular.ttf font-family into my CSS code using @font-face.
I don’t understand whether to write the src as

Hi, so I have a list and I’ve made it an inline-block so I can make a navigation bar. The list, however, is not in the centre.
This is an example from the Broadway example from the CSS lesson.
HTML:
<header>

        <nav>

          <ul>

            <li> About </li> <li> Work </li> <li> Team </li> <li> Contact </li>

          </ul>

        </nav>

    </header>

CSS:
nav li {

  color: #fff;

  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;

  font-weight: 600;

  font-size: 12px;

  display: inline-block;

}

Yea, I’ll try to give you more clues.
Try inspect element on the header and see if you notice anything funny. That’s the biggest clue.
@dinnosam I’ll leave what I think is the answer here, it might depend on the rest of your code though.


Answer
Change the width of header to be 100% and set its text-align to center.


So I noticed that the margin gives the individual list items space to be centered, but I can’t get it to center when I include display: inline-block;

Check the width of header. What is it showing up as?

Is that what you meant?
2020-07-15 (4)1896×859 567 KB

Yea, is that what you wanted?

yup, but I had to guess the padding to center it. Is there a way to do it without guessing?

text-align: center; (in the header css, which will affect the whole nav)

It didn’t work still. I’ll keep trying. Thank you!

Try outlining the border of nav, and of header with different colors. It’ll give you more clues as to how you can manipulate them

18,Chrome DevToools question,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
Hello everyone! I am stuck with the Chrome DevTools exercise (https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/local-website-development/videos/intro-to-chrome-devtools). I can open the tools, no problem, but then I can’t find how to change things the way it’s explained in the video (for example, simply changing a color of some element). Everything looks differently in reality than in the video and whatever I change in styling does not appear on the webpage I’m trying to change. Does anyone have a similar problem?How did you solve it? Thank a lot!

Hey there @mega0332272320!! Welcome to the Codecademy forums

19,A real-world use case for Multiple Classes?,"Get Help,CSS",general,3,"
Hello,
I understand the functionality of multiple classes - how to assign them to an HTML element, and how to target them using CSS.
Can someone please show me an example where this would come in handy?
The rational for using this is unclear to me.
","
This is actually something I’m using in my personal project in creating an interactive periodic table! Here’s a screenshot below.
image1894×855 229 KB
Each of the elements use the same .element class to style how they look, as well as the example element and the hover effect of increasing the size. However, elements come in groups (eg. alkali metals, transition metals etc.) and so they need their own colour styling. Therefore each element also has a group class which assigns the background color. I also intend to possibly have a different class depending on the melting/boiling points, which could allow a colour scale based on their state at certain temperatures.
This is just my personal project example, there’s many real world examples out there too for times you might wish to assign multiple classes. Generally, it’s in the cases where elements can be in multiple “groups” that all require the same styling, but those groups don’t always overlap, like a Venn Diagram.

The keyword here is overlap. All of the elements in your periodic table have CSS properties that apply to all of them, and some other CSS properties that are group-specific. So to prevent the need to repeat the properties that apply to all of the elements, you just apply them once to the “general” class.
Thanks Adam, your answer needs to be linked inside the lesson.
"
20,Content-box / border-box,"Get Help,CSS",,9,"
Is there one I should use over the other or is it a personal preference/ situational choice?
","
It’s a technical choice, not a personal preference. When tightness of fit is not a concern then the border can be outside of the content box, but if the size is critical for the right fit, then the border should go inside the content box.

Addendum
https://repl.it/@mtf/border-box-vs-content-box

In the above, on the left the border is outside of the content box, on the right the border is inside content box.

So, the border can still be manipulated, only from within?
And, your dimensions aren’t 300x300px (for the content) + the 20px (padding) + 2 px (border). Instead, your dimensions already include the pre-set border and padding sizes.

The default border is inside the margin but outside of the content box. That would be the one on the left, above.

But, you can’t still manipulate the border after you set box-sizing: border-box; can you?

Go to the link above and click Run. Now hover on the right hand box.

I tried it, but I’m afraid I still don’t understand. I’ll keep trying

We’ve only compared the two CSS states. CSS drives the visual, and that’s what is being demonstrated. It’s done with script and DOM event detection. Remember, the DOM is where everything happens.

Just add display: block; to the video class, it’ll allow you to center it. (otherwise margin: auto doesn’t know what to do)
Display is necessary for CSS to know whether you want grid, flex, inline types of behaviors to your elements.



MDN Web Docs



display
The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

is it because of the order? because it works after i move the codes related to font to the beginning.

You’re missing a closing bracket in your #firebrick declaration in the css. This is making the rest of the code afterwards break.
I figured it out by copying and pasting it in my sublime code editor (but any code editor will do). The color for the class after firebrick was different so that’s what gave me the clue.

23,Dasmoto's: CSS won't link to HTML,"Get Help,CSS",,14,"
Hi,
I’m going through Codecademy’s CSS and HTML practice, currently working on the Dasmoto’s project in Atom. I’ve looked at plenty of forum topics where users had a similar problem but none of what I found in them helped. Can you please have a look at it and tell me what I’m missing?
This is the head of my HTML file:

The CSS file is located in the same directory and is named styles.css. I tried both adding and omitting the ./ in the href attribute but neither worked.
","
Hi. Put it in a same folder and remove the ./ before the css file. It works fine for me(I’m working on something else). 

Hi,
Thanks for your quick reply. I removed the ./ but it still isn’t working. The .html and the .css files are in the same folder and have been since I created them. I know this is how it’s supposed to work but for some reason I can’t imagine, it doesn’t.

Did you put a / after the linking? 

Tried both with and without (on the screenshot I attached, it’s not there, in the current version of the file, it is there), didn’t make any difference. I also tried rearranging the order of the attributes but apparently that doesn’t matter either.

Problem eventually overrode by deleting the link element and copying my CSS elements into the head using the style element.
However, I prefer not doing that in future projects if I don’t have to, so if anyone can spot the mistake in my original post, feel free to reply.

Please remember to include a link to the exercise when posting a new topic relating to a lesson. We cannot verify and confirm anything until we see the actual exercise page.

I hope this is what you mean: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/web-dev-html-css-practice/projects/dasmoto
But it turns out my problem is unrelated to the exercise itself. I’ve found other exercises online for practice and I’m still facing the same problem: regardless of how I link the CSS file to the HTML, the browser will simply ignore it and just render everything in the default style. Everything works well when I incorporate the CSS code in the HTML code using the style tag, so the problem must be the linking.

I’ve put the stylesheet in a css folder…
<head>
  <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
  <title>Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts</title>
  <link href=""./css/style.css"" rel=""stylesheet""/>
</head>


Hi i’ve figured it out. It needs two dots:

<link href=""../styles.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" />


That puts the CSS file in a directory above the index.html file which is not good design. What if index.html is the home page? There is no directory above it since it is in the root directory. Move your css file to a css directory in the same directory as index.html.
+ projects/
  + dasmotos/    <- site root
    + images/
      * picture.png
    + css/
      * styles.css
    + js/
      * script.js
    * index.html

Did you ever find out why this happenes? I’m having the same problem

In a URL, ./ means same directory as the current html page. If we organize our project in its own folder, then that becomes the site root. That’s the ./ that our page(s) refer to. The current working directory.
Our index.html file will be in this directory. It makes sense to organize script into a script folder (js) and style sheets into a styles folder (css). The paths to those files will be,
./css/styles.css

and,
./js/script.js

It follows we will have an images folder, as well. The only file that needs to be on the site root is, index.html
Think site root so that you get your bearings on web server and design all your navigation relative to that. The home page is on the site root and should be the default page if not specified in the URL.
https://www.codecademy.com/

will open up on their home page. That’s how web servers work. Don’t try this on your own machine, it won’t work, but we can still devise our project folders as site roots, each and every one.

I was having the same problem with the CSS not linking in the HTML properly, and my site kept coming up with basic HTML styling. I read through everyone’s comments here and realized that my problem was that I had put my index.html file INSIDE my “resources” file, rather than alongside resources in the overall project folder I called “Dasmoto.” I thought it was a problem with this:

But it was not- It was a problem with the way I had initially set up my folders for this project. SO frustrating, but I'm glad I found the solution here!!

Hey!
Should be fixed if you change your bio-three class to include vertical-align: top; and text-align center and remove text-align: justify from your h3.
Whenever I’m in doubt, I check MDN documentation (it’s really a gold standard). The key is what to check? In this case, because your element is a td (table data cell), I would check here. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td. Note that you do have to read the fine print on what’s deprecated  and what they recommend for current use.

Thanks again for your help!

So cool!

What is the ideal color system in a professional environment.
","
Hey there @datasolver32101!! Welcome to the Codecademy forums! 
I don’t believe there is any system that is the ideal one.
It is usally a personal preference. I prefer the hexadecimal system because I find it the easiest to understand and write, though RGB is a close second.
Several common ones seen in web design are RGB, HEX, and HSV.
RGB and HEX, are both based on mixing the three primary light colors, red green and blue, to make the color you desire.
However HSV is based on:
Hue: the degrees around a color wheel
Saturation: How much of that basic color is added
And volume: How bright the color is
The majority of the color systems can display the exact same shade, the only difference is in the syntax:
#000000                 //Black
#FFFFFF                 //White
#0000FF                 //Blue

rgb(0, 0, 0)            //black
rgb(255, 255, 255)      //White
rgb(0, 0, 255)          //Blue

hsv(0, 0%, 0%)          //Black
hsv(0, 0%, 100%)        //White
hsv(240, 0%, 0%)        //Blue

I would suggest experiment using different ones, and find which one you prefer.

Hi @datasolver32101 ,
Welcome I hope you are liking codecademy… It’s the best platform to learn coding and has an amazing community 
I personally use Hex and Rgb because they provide amazing color variations…
Rest is up to you to decide just like @8-bit-gaming says.
Thanks and keep coding

26,Mobile first concept,"Get Help,CSS",general,8,"
i hope this is the right place…
mobile first concept i get… start small, grow to larger sizes
also mobile first helps decipher what is most relevant give the small real estate
any tips on actually getting into my text editor and start coding mobile first?
are there samples out here? some you tubes i did not find helpful
i think css grid would be a good idea
especially grid template areas
that way i have control over what goes where and size… mobile first 1 column, css grid more than 1 column?
in my text editor do i code like i would any size THEN use media queries?
no media query for the mobile first code, then media queries for tablet, laptop, desktop etc.
anything else i should know?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!!

Look into figma. I really love it for designing sketches of what I’m going to design in css. Having a sketch gives you a lot more focus as to what css is needed and let’s you see what works and what doesn’t visually. (They have a lot of tutorials on how to make mobile sketches).
If you design it mobile first your queries can scale up. Remember to use your inspect element on your browser to see how it looks like in phone view (and don’t neglect that rotation view, it can often break otherwise ok looking sites).
And good luck 

Thank you!
i found figma, though (to me) doesn’t help
so i go back to my original post… how do i code for mobile first?
i understand its a concept… i am having trouble putting mobile first concept into mobile first code
you could say “its just code” but i still don’t get it
is there a specific method?
is it simply a style of coding small and then add more per media query?
where can i see (video?)  coding small and then add more per media query?
especially the use of media queries
i do get the concept of media queries
a thorough explanation would be golden to me!
again, use CSS Grid? grid template areas?
you can read i am a bit confused
MANY THANKS!!


so i go back to my original post… how do i code for mobile first?

So you might be aware there’s an inspect element option in the browser, and if you check through the buttons, there’s a button to simulate the browser in a phone view (it even gives you a range of phone models to pick from).
You could start by having your initial layout scheme layed out with dummy content (fake picture, fake text) and see how it looks there. You want will want to use a border outline (not just plain border at least to make sense of how the containers are playing with each other.
Once you see it like this, it’s really just a matter of vertically designing it.
Here’s an exercise that might help you think about it.
Look at a famous news website. How do they style elements in phone view vs browser mode?
We’d imagine there’s “article” elements. In a phone they should probably be flat thin rectangles mainly conveying the article name, and at best a small picture. This thin rectangle takes up 100% of the screen width. You would style it so that they stack like a building. The main css (outside the media query) would aim for that.
Now, if you just have a full monitor screen full of flat little rectangles stacked it wouldn’t work. Here’s where you use the media query and you tell these elements to be bigger boxes (maybe more variety in the size of rectangles to allow for interesting aesthetic etc).
Now, figma might not be your thing, but I’d still recommend to draw this out. It will give your css more focus on what it aims to do. Again, it’s a suggestion from personally struggling to adjust complicated designs from the css alone (and watching other people squander time like that).

Try to see if you can classify the page elements here so that you have css that targets all these things. The better one gets at doing this the easier it is to manipulate the styles later.

No I’m just another student on these forums haha. It’s all in the spirit of sharing.

vertically designing

That was basically what the flat thin boxes were.

is CSS Grid or grid template areas a bad idea for coding larger screens?
just media queries?

I like to personally use flexbox. You could do grid but I can’t give you specifics since I don’t use grid often.

“bigger boxes” with media queries caught my eye
how can i use media queries for bigger boxes?

Yea so like in the full screen view example of bbc, I’d divide that into two main containers LEFT and RIGHT. The right one would house 4 little boxes in a grid, the left one would just house one big box.

Thanks again!
i gave it some thought, i think grid template areas will work well here
i am working on the preliminary steps for  site… i hope to use what you recommended for my mobile first coding
i would like to share my mobile first code with you…
BTW if at all interested, look into CSS Grid and specifically grid template areas
they make layout SO much more simple and organized

27,General CSS targeting question,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",3,"
Good afternoon,
I’m working through a tutorial for a side navigation menu, and the CSS is like this:
.side-menu {

            font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

            list-style: none;

            border: 1px #dddddd solid;

            border-radius: 10px;

            width: 300px;

            padding: 20px;

        }

        

        .side-menu li {

            font-size: 18px;

            line-height: 2.4em;

            border-bottom: dotted 2px #dddddd;

        }

        

        .side-menu li:last-child {

            border: none;

        }

        .side-menu li a {

            color: #333333;

            text-decoration: none;

        }

        .side-menu li a:hover {

            color: coral;

    

        }

What I don’t understand about CSS, in general, is why I couldn’t just put the  .side-menu li a  items in with the .side-menu items. Like text-decoration in this case. I figured that if I targeted a parent and changed a property value, all children would do the same thing unless I targeted the children and changed that same property’s value.
So if I set text decoration to none in .side-menu here, the anchors are still underlined, which seems counter-intuitive to me. Or am I doing something else wrong or looking at things in the wrong way?

Not all CSS properties are inherited by child elements, though.

text-decoration is not an inheritable property, so you need to apply a CSS ruleset specifying text-decoration to override the default style.
If you look at the text-decoration specifications on MDN you’ll see that it’s not inherited.
Setting the rule on a parent element which has class=""side-menu"", with a li child element which in turn has an anchor (a) child itself won’t apply the rule to the anchor element. It needs to be applied directly, as you’ve found, though you can force inheritance. 

Ah. So some things are inherited and some things aren’t. Kinda like with people. Seems like an odd way to write a style language that seems to rely heavily on parents and children and trunks and branches and twigs and such, but it is what it is I suppose. Thanks for clearing that up.

Yes, I am running into a similar problem. Been scouring the web for days looking for a solution.

What is your full code and what is your file structure? There are several things that could be stopping it from linking so I’ll need to see a bunch of it before being able to tell the problem.

<#/body>
<#/html>
As for the CSS code, it looks like this:
.h1 {
font-family: Helvetica;
font-size: 100px;
font-weight: bold;
color: khaki;
text-align: center;
background-image: url(resources\images\pattern.jpg);
}
.h2 {
font-family: Helvetica;
font-size: 32px;
font-weight: bold;
color: white;
}
#Brushes {
background-color: mediumspringgreen;
}
#Frames {
background-color: lightcoral;
}
#Paint {
background-color: skyblue;
}
Finally, the file tree looks like this:
Dasmoto’s Arts and Crafts
/(file)dasmoto’s.html
/(folder)resources
//(folder)css
///(file)style.css
//(folder)images
///(image)
///(image)

Both of those are the entire files. I am using visual studio code. I must say, during the coursework for CSS, I could not get any of the css changes to display EXCEPT for the very first introduction example to CSS. I am starting to think something is wrong with my computer. Am I missing something involving CSS? I’ve retaken the entire course twice to find it.

Hi! Thanks for sharing your code!
Remember, whatever you want to affect has to have css targeting it. I only see this being affected:
<header class=""everything""> 
  <h1 >Samster</h1>
  <h1>Everything_</h1>
</header>

If you can’t tell if the element targeting is working or not, try changing the color or the border (something obvious).
If you right click and do inspect element in the browser, you can find tools to click around the screen and see if your elements are properly being targeted by your css.
Also, <tabel> should be <table> and </table> or it won’t display properly.

Thank you for those tips! So, I tried to add a border to the header below and it worked. The border showed in the browser, but I still cannot move my text.
  <h1 >Samster</h1>
  <h1>Everything_</h1>
</header>```

That’s more of a matter of controlling your container sizes and layouts. You can view your containers like so:

Screen Shot 2020-07-06 at 6.01.37 PM812×394 27 KB
At first I like setting up big container boxes that are going to be in my page (so a big body one, maybe one for left-content, right-content columns that go inside the body container).
I color them in obvious colors like red, blue, yellow, to position them precisely. When I’m happy with that layout, I remove the color and put my content inside, now I know when I move those boxes, the content will follow.
This is just one technique, and as you get used to it. It’s easier to do without the color help.

It’s still not working. I still can’t move my text to be on top of anything else

Hey can you share your code again of your new attempts?

Hi,
It seems like when I add the following code in a specific order (making sure to include position and text-align) I can move text around my page but I don’t really know if the text is actually perfectly aligned because I don’t know how.
This is the HTML
<html>

<head>
  <title></title>
  <link href=""style.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
</head>

<body class=""body"">
  <div class=""header"">
    <img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/travel.jpeg"" />
    <h1 class=""name"">OLIVIA WOODRUFF</h1>```





**This is the CSS**

```  .name {
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  top: -150px;
  left: 2.5px;
}```

The alignment works  if you want to make the container smaller, you can set a fixed width like 80-90% so it doesn’t fill the whole screen. That way, if you align it right or left, it only goes so far (not all the way to the edge).

interesting what you said about the container size! I’ve also been struggling with that too! Thank you

Another useful look at how your H1 is interpreted.

@dinnosam
Whenever I’m doing a project and it’s time to implement design, I spend a lot of time with the MDN documentation because CSS is not what I’m doing every day. Another good resource for ideas is Kevin Powell’s youtube channel. I should probably get royalties for how much I recommend it but it really is useful for breaking down css concepts in real practical terms (unlike the way I break them down ahhahahah)

  thank you! I’ll definitely check it out!

Hello @jackrie!! Welcome to the forums 
If I understand correctly, you want the pictures to be center underneath their corresponding <h4> element, please correct me if I am wrong about this.
Have you tried:
display: flex;
margin: auto;

Hopefully this is helpful 

Thank you! That does center them, but I am trying to have them display like this:

Hi,
you should create a CSS selector for your
<div class=""flex-container items"">

in your *.css file. (Rename it to “flex-container-items”)
.flex-container-items {
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
justify-content: center;
}

My css-code ist not the solution. I didn’t test it. Here is a link that explains flexboxes (in that case for a horizontal navigation bar). It helped me alot to understand Flexboxes: Flexbox

I have the same problem

Hi there!
The answers these two gave me helped to point me in the right direction. One of the main issues I discovered was that I created more divs within my container div for the store that were not needed. Take a look back through your code and make sure you didn’t do the same. Good luck!!!

Hi Jackrie
Thank You for your advice.
Still, I have no idea what the problem might be.  I don’t know why the images 4 and 5 go one under the other.

Hi glandaeta31,
I took a look at your code and it looks like you are missing a closing  tag underneath seasonal donuts. Once you put that in there it will help, but it looks like you’ll have some more tinkering to do with your CSS to get the results you want. I hope this helps!

I really appreciate your help.

I’d take this in mozilla, and inspect the boxes that are being thrown down. You can see what the specific css making it do that: (this button helps you hover and select specific elements). 
I’d recommend going through this documentation also!: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container

34,Can't get 100vh/100% to work,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",4,"
Hello! I’ve been trying desperately to get my nav bar to extend the full viewport height, but for the life of me I can’t figure out what I’m missing. It extends a bit, then just stops. I have the body and html set to 100, but the dang child refuses to inherit. I’ve tried using just percentages, and then just using vh, but neither worked. Any advice would be appreciated!

Hey! We’ve all been there…  Try running it on firefox and use this handy button (after right-click inspect element).  
Then, when you hover over your nav bar, it can tell you what it’s interpreting your nav bar attributes to be (and will not only give you a warning for css errors, but a link to possible solutions in the MDN documentation!).

Thank you! I inspected it, and the div wasn’t inheriting its height from the body. I tried getting rid of the float and other variables…it still refuses to inherit height from the body. I ended up just setting its position to fixed. I’m still at a loss for why it won’t work.

It has to do with syntax. When in doubt, you can just be specific. But you should play around with this and check the MDN documentation in depth to see more specific cases  Note: there are more precise and fancy ways ( [class*=""button-""]) to do this than my example but this is just a basic idea.
.button {
  display: block;
  border-radius: 1em;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

.button-warning {
  background: none;
  color: red;
 
}

//in html
<a class=""button button-warning"">Warning</a>
// this means button-warning ""inherits"" the qualities of button

@margcee I’d be remiss if I didn’t recommend Kevin Powell’s css tutorials on youtube. They are the best ones (in my opinion) by leaps and bounds and very easy to understand.

Hi
I hope you can help me. I tried to change the code in
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-display-positioning/exercises/review-css-display-positioning
but it only worked for question 1. I couldn’t fix the remaining questions. Can you tell me what’s wrong or who could explain me? Sometimes CSS is somewhat misterious. Thanks

Hello @byte9708887761,
The Review: Layout lesson is an opportunity for you to practice and experiment. You can change colors, margins, positions, or whatever you want in order to practice. It is up to you to decide how you would like the page to look.
There is no single right or wrong answer for this lesson. Just use your best judgment for redesigning the page. Change as little or as much of it as you want. As you do this, you can look back at the previous lessons in order to review and reinforce your understanding regarding how the CSS works.

Hi, here is my folder with images and codes (I ll copy and paste the html file since dropbox doesn’t show my code for that file)

I’m studying CSS and HTML on this web site and now I’m not able to put the footer on the bottom of the page (I already tried all the solutions found on stackoverflow).
Also, I would like to know the width in pixels when somebody zooms a web page and the most common width of the devices in order to make my project responsive.
If you find any stupids codes and you know how to improve them, please feel free to tell me your changes since it is only a week that I know CSS. Thank you in advance.

Try this for the footer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc2olxLgKLk

and then I added this to the css
.footer_2_container, .footer_2_container a {
color: darkslategray;
text-decoration: none;
margin-right: 10px;

}
.footer_container {
display: inline-flex;
width: 100%;
justify-content: space-between;   
margin-top: 150px;
margin-bottom: 10px;

}
.footer_container h4 {
font-weight: normal;
margin-left: 20px;

}
thank you!
I have a question, everywhere it says that this should happen when there is not much content so why it happened to me? There is a lot of content in this project and in another projects that I have done with less content everything worked just fine!

Yea the multiple containers would work just like a navbar (one for the bar, the other for the buttons).

I have a question, everywhere it says that this should happen when there is not much content so why it happened to me? There is a lot of content in this project and in another projects that I have done with less content everything worked just fine!

I think what is meant by that is that you want to make sure to get your base layout set before completing all the middle content? I’m not sure by what you mean of everywhere, if you can find a link I can give you my opinion.
Glad you got it!

by everywhere I meant ALL the pages of stackoverflow where programmers say that sometimes, when the web page doesn’t have much content, the footer is at the middle of the page instead of the bottom.
This problem it happened to me as well but the thing is that there was already a lot of content and on other 2 projects that I have done (with like half of the half of the content compared to this new project) it didn’t happen.
So my question is why the footer wasn’t at the bottom of the page even though there was a lot of content?
Sorry if I didn’t make myself clear or if you find some mistakes in my writing, english is my 2nd language so I know that is not perfect ahah 

Here’s a clever solution with flexbox: https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/

Did you look at it with with an ‘inspect element’ in chrome or firefox? It’ll show you how your css is being interpreted. So if you go back to your code, and try to draw it from its directions, you’ll see why the browser chose to interpret it like that. I prefer Firefox’s inspector, once you right-click and go to inspect element, this handy button lets you hover over all your elements and see outlines/info.


Thank you so much, that will help! <3

Hi!
Your links are linked to your local directory so we won’t be able to see them.
Normally in html you would do something like this:
<img src=""some_image.jpg"" alt=""Some image Title"">
but this doesn’t mean that the title will appear visibly.
Maybe you mean for the title to be somewhere else, or to appear on hover, that would have to be done differently… if you can’t share the link, can you give a screenshot?

any help is appreciated!!!

This is a property of flex! If you go to that lesson and have a look at the DevTools, and then go to the container with class gallery, then you’ll see the code giving this shape is
.gallery {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-top: 20px;
}

flex is what is giving this the ability to position dynamically on the page, and then the flex-wrap property specifies that you want the child elements (in this case the images) to wrap when it reaches the end of the page.

Many thanks! i have spent some time trying to learn this…

help me make it responsive? its totally wonky on my smart phone… even with a media query
BOY am i grateful to you for helping me out!
MANY THANKS!!!

I believe the issue is your img CSS. When you set the width of an img element to a percentage, then the image will always scale with the size of the page, so the img elements will never need to overflow. By setting a hardcoded width, the img elements will not resize and will overflow, thus having the desired effect. So you would want
img {
   width: 250px;
   height: auto;
}

and then you should have the wrapping. Also the exact size you want can change if you want the images bigger or smaller.

BINGO!!!
i have what i was after!
thank you so much!
i could not have figured this out without your instruction!
follow up…
how do i make this code responsive? i understand px are not relative units
again, i thank you!

px are not, however if you want the images to also resize when the screen gets too small for them, then you need to wrap them in a <figure> tag. Then you can edit the max-width for figure to get what I think you are looking for. For example, here’s the code I used to get that functionality on your website.
HTML
<body>
   <div class=""gallery"">
     <figure>  
      <img src=""BGT images photo shop/Morocco 645_1.jpg"" class=""responsive"">
     </figure>
     <figure>
      <img src=""BGT images photo shop/Morocco 649_1.jpg"" class=""responsive"">
     </figure>
     <figure>
      <img src=""BGT images photo shop/Morocco 659_1.jpg"" class=""responsive"">
     </figure>
   </div>   
</body>
</html>

CSS
.gallery {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: center;
      margin-top: 20px;
  }
 
figure {
  max-width: 450px;
  margin:0;
}

img {
      width: 100%;
}

By moving the max-width: 450px; to the figure tag, your images will be no bigger than 450px, however they are able to shrink when the page gets too small to hold them. The figure tag is required as flex is applied to the direct child element. Therefore what is happening is the flex-wrap is applying to the figure, which can only be at more 450px, and then the img is being forced to stay the full width of the figure tag. Therefore you’re able to get both the flex-wrap effect and the resizing effect simultaneously.
Hopefully this makes sense, try out adding the figures in the way I did above and then doing the CSS, and then play with it in DevTools to see the difference when the figure wrappers are removed.

Does one need to add space when trying to be specific with targeting a CSS selector? For example, when targeting a class that is a child of an HTML elements, should there be a space between the parent element and the child class that is being targeted, as in this exercise here
It appears that when I add space, I see the effect but when I don’t, I don’t see the effect.
","
Do mean like this?
<div class=""parent"">
  <p class=""child"">
    A very long important paragraph about important stuff.
  </p>
</div>

div .child { //spacing in selector
  color: red;
} 

VERSUS:
div.child {  //no spacing in selector
  color: red;
}


If so than yes the spacing matters.
Without the space div.child the code is checking for <div> elements that have a class of child.
Whereas div .child is checking for elements that are children of a <div> and have a class of child.

Awesome!  That was what I meant and thanks for the clarification.

At the end i find the way using google and applying this :
table {
margin-left:auto;

","
The best way to do it is usually exactly how you did it, although you can write that a little cleaner as
table {
   margin: 0 auto;
}

Which sets the top & bottom margins to 0, and centers the table.

Have you tried using only the align code instead of using text-align? Or, alternatively, you can do this;
Table {
padding-right:###
}

or
Table {
padding-left:###
}

According to what fits your need. Hope this helps!

Thanks for your help, just one thing can you tell me how they did it in the example cheat sheet that they gave us?




 adamgaffney137183916:

margin: 0 auto;


This only works if we give the table a width property that is less than the viewport it is rendered in.



 obidigbo:

padding-right:###


Not a good suggestion. Padding should be used very sparingly and in closed controlled situations. Centering a table is not one of them.
Also, Table is not the correct selector. table is.

I personally like to work with percentages and media queries. So for example the container containing an important paragraph of text will get 100% width on cell, but as the screens are larger I’ll have a proportion that is more aesthetically appropriate.

As far as I know there is no way to tell, since the browsers width is determined on the users device, based on their personal preference.
Which is why you can use a mixture of  percentages and pixels to determine the size of a container. Such as the following example:
div {
  max-width: 50%;
  min-width: 500px;
}

This means the container will attempt to fill up 50% of the screens width, but won’t drop below 500px wide.

Thinking of it like layers, the outer layer is always going to be the one interacting with outside elements (other boxes). The inner layer (content) is just going to deal with all inner elements. This is incredibly useful for segmenting your layout into logical forms that can be responsive.
This is particularly important because in the outer layer you define the skeleton of your design (head, arms, torso, etc) but the inner you describe in specific detail how you want things to look and be placed (eyes, mouth, nose). E.g you would never want the nose to appear in the arms – hence the division.

Using google with search query: css background no scroll
lead me to: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment
which contains your answer.

@obxjuggler, I think what you are looking for is called a parallax.
To do this you would create a  or  in your html, then assign that class (.parallax in css) a background-image.  Set the background-image to:
/* Parallax Section */
.parallax {
	background-color: #4181C3;
	background-image: url(PARALLAX-wave.png);
	height: 400px;
	background-attachment: fixed;
	background-size: cover;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: center center;
}

I think the key you are looking for is ‘background-attachment: fixed;’
Keep in mind it’s important to set a background color, because the parallax feature does not work on mobile devices.  If you still want the image to appear on mobile devices, you can set a @media query, and just remove the ‘fixed’.
Hope that helps.

I am doing project css task board and it’s seems that my completed project column is all the time uneven and I can’t find out why? I tried to do this project three times, watched walked through video, but I don’t know what I am doing wrong. Could anyone help me?
Thanks!

When you say uneven what do you mean? Are they not equally spaced out like the other columns, or are they spaced differently to the other columns, or something else?

Hey there @cloudjumper83369 
Could you post your code formatted using the button at the top of the post menu?
It look like this </>

I too am curious what exactly you mean by uneven, could you also post your HTML so we can run the code?

@cloudjumper83369 -
Maybe include a screenshot of your project so we can all see what issue is, visuals speak mountains!

60,Cozy Tea Project,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",7,"
Hi there.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/layout-with-flexbox/projects/tea-cozy
I am trying to format the images in the  Tea of the month section to display like this.
 



My code currently looks like this:
HTML
    <h2>Tea of the Month</h2>

    <p>What's Steeping at The Tea Cozy?</p>

    <div class=""container1"" id = ""row"">

        <div  class = ""teaPic"" >

            <img src=""images\img-berryblitz.jpg"">

            <h4>Fall Berry Blitz Tea</h4>

        </div>

        <div  class = ""teaPic"" >

            <img src=""images\img-spiced-rum.jpg"">

            <h4>Spiced Rum Tea</h4>

        </div>

        <div  class = ""teaPic"" >

            <img src=""images\img-donut.jpg"">

            <h4>Seasonal Donuts</h4>

        </div>

        <div  class = ""teaPic"" >

            <img src=""images\img-myrtle-ave.jpg"">

            <h4>Myrtle Ave Tea</h4>

        </div>

        <div  class = ""teaPic"" >

            <img src=""images\img-bedford-bizarre.jpg"">

            <h4>Bedford Bizarre Tea</h4>

        </div>

    </div>

</section>

CSS:
.container1 {
display: flex;

flex-wrap: wrap;

justify-content: center;

}

.teaPic {
display: flex;

height: 200px;

width: 300px;

padding: 10px;

margin: auto;

}

currently being rendered like this??

You are currently setting the height and width of the .teaPic div container, but not of the images themselves. As such it’s shrinking the container but not the image and you’re losing a lot of the image. You need to set the height and width for the images too, either individually through the img tags, or universally using CSS pointing to the img tags.

Thanks very much!
Sometimes it needs an extra pair of eyes :).
Follow up question… the images are now on a separate line with the  h4’s next to it.
Any idea how to format them so they’re the same as in the first pic?
I’m still trying to get my head around this Flexbox stuff

Css currently looks like:
.container1 {
display: flex;

flex-wrap: wrap;

justify-content: center;

}

.teaPic {
display: flex;

height: auto;

width: 1000px;

padding: 10px;

margin: auto;

}
.teaPic img {
height: 200px;

width: 300px;

}

What you’ll need to do is give the container for the images a width, so .container1 needs a width, so say for testing sake width: 1000px. Then you would give it the property align-content: space-between and this should arrange your images in such a way that it uses all the space evenly like that. Then play around with the width of the container to get it looking how you would like!

thanks dude, appreciate it

61,I cannot create relative path links,"Get Help,CSS",general,20,"
I am trying to make a basic website on visual studio code editor as part of the arts & crafts project
Firstly emphasized item problems are appearing and I cannot see any problems with my code. How do I get these to go away or at least show me what is wrong.
Secondly and most annoyingly I’m having a major frustrating issue trying to create relative links either from files like images or to the style.css sheet. I spent hours linking the style sheet to the HTML index file earlier and I could only do it by copying the address from inside ‘my documents’ which then appeared to be the same address as the copied path from within VSC!?
This is a recurring problem it only works when I copy the entire path and then I can delete part of the path.
I have now managed to insert images by doing this(copying full path from outside VSC). But I want to know why is not working by simply typing the full address or part of the address within VSC like so=
<img src=""\images\image title.jpeg>
I have tried / / and \ and I have tried just clicking the images and copying path. I have tried with and without type=“text/css”  the style sheet just would not link the way I learnt in codeacademy…
I have put an example of my problem in the image attached, check line 13 image labelled troubleshooting.
As before the word troubleshooting is displayed and the picture will not appear with a relative link.
Neither will it appear if I type more parent folders or forward or backslash.
It’s very frustrating and help would be hugely appreciated!
I have googled and checked the cheatsheet and the code I’m writing is definitely correct so must be another problem that I cannot see.

hey asurasnyx,
it should work with the ./ and the relative file path:
<img src=""./images/title.jpg"">


If all of the files needed are on your computer, it may simplify things to try putting them in the same folder.
On my computer, if I have the HTML file in the same folder as my CSS file, I can just refer to it by name and not need to do the long file path.

I have tried this and have the same issue.

OK so i have tried this and discovered that if the file is in the same folder as the HTML file then there is no problem. However if i move it into a parent folder then the problem still occurs. Obviously to complete the task I can just keep the files in the same folder. But this is not a proper solution as I want to be able to have files in appropriate folders and link them.

The full path isnt even working in CSS ? ! !
See row 3 in example. I click + control on the link never works?
can someone please help! it’s so annoying. Works if all files are in the same folder but even just moved into the parent folder it stops working?!
cannot find it|690x346 
still not working1704×747 52.5 KB


@asurasnyx,
It looks like the problem is that you are using the backslash (\) in your path.  In many languages (including CSS, I believe) this character is what is known as an escape character.  You can tell by the way it is a different color in VS Code in your screenshot.
To make that path work, there are a few things you can do:

You can replace your backslashes with forward slashes (/).  Notice that in @sonnynomnom’s reply, he recommended ./ and not .\.
Alternatively, if you really love the Windows-style backslash, you can put two of them instead of one and the path should work as intended.  For example, your path would be url(""your\\path\\here\\Resources\\images\\background.jpeg"")

Finally, you can use the shortcut ../ to reference a file in the parent folder.  In your case, you would type url(""../images/background.jpeg"")


Hope this explanation helps.  Happy coding!

that makes sense, I will try to write with forward slash instead. Although I had directly copied and pasted the path from the image in the left pane.
I have tried both forward and backslash and neither work for linking a background image.
I tried linking the URL from a website instead of my local drive and it worked.
But the background image just will not load from my path.
The background image is now in with my style.css sheet and works.
But i still don’t understand why the image has to be in the same folder as my style sheet to work?
I would love to know why? I feel this might present problems in the future.
Many thanks in advance!

One other thing, and I could be completely wrong here, Is the hard drive letter you have in the file path correct? Most computers label the main hard drive as C were as you choice D.
Though if you are using an unusual OS, or you are like me and have 6 drives on one computer , than Drive D makes perfect since.
I think @el_cocodrilo is pointing out your main problem, but the drive name is something to watch out for.

I’m having the same issue as asurasnyx with the background image for the header Dasmoto’s Arts and Crafts not loading. I’ve gone through all the suggestions on here, checked the cheat sheet, Googled help for it, and right clicked to “inspect” the code to see what I might be doing wrong. I’ve got the forward slashes, the image was saved locally and have tried numerous variations of the background-image line in the css file with no success of the image showing up. I had to walk away from this yesterday as frustration was getting the better of me.  It feels like I’m missing something minor, but for the life of me can’t figure out what it is.
Is the html file supposed to have something that mirrors the line for the background images in css? I’ve only got the Dasmoto’s Arts & Crafts that would “correspond” with the background image in the css file.
The line currently looks as follows specifically for the background-image line:
background-image: url(""./images/pattern.jpeg"");
Thanks.

I’ve had the same issue on Visual Studio when completing the Dasmoto’s Arts and Crafts project.
I’m using a Safari browser. When I open the index.html file in the browser it looks as though the link to the css file doesn’t work. When I manually add the css file to the page in Safari by opening Preferences->Advanced Options->Stylesheet->Add File, the CSS renders as expected.
Here’s the code in the document head:
<head>
    <title>Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts</title>
    <link href=""/dasmotos/resources/css/index.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"">
</head>

Racking my brains around this one, so any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Unless the HTML code you are trying to ling to the stylesheet is in the folder “dasmotos” , than you will need to include the full file path, starting with the letter of the hard drive it is in.

I’m wondering whether some of the confusion here is around the nature of relative paths. Perhaps an example will help.
I’ve done the Dasmoto project on my local computer, using Visual Studio Code. I have a single directory (folder) - which is, incidentally, also a Git repo - called Codecademy, and within that I have another directory called Dasmoto. Here’s a screenshot of the folder structure:

So, my “parent” directory for the purposes of the Dasmoto project is the Dasmoto directory. That’s where my index.html file is, and it’s also where the image dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg has been saved. (Remember, the “redline” is the diagram showing you what the finished product should look like.)
Below that, I have two more directories:
css, containing my stylesheet file style.css,
and img, containing the four images I need for the site.
Within index.html, I can reference my stylesheet with the following tag:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""./css/style.css""/>

This is because, from index.html's perspective, it’s current directory is Dasmoto/.
The period . tells the rendering engine ""start in the current directory, then go to /css/style.css.
If, however, I changed my structure around (the green items are new - thanks Git tracking!):

You see how my index.html page is now in a subdirectory of Dasmoto called www. My link to the CSS no longer works, because ./css/style.css is looking for Dasmoto/www/css/style.css which doesn’t exist.
We can work around this by using the double-period .., which tells the system to “go up one directory” before continuing on the path, so I need to change my tag like so:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/style.css""/>

So, with index.html in the www subdirectory this tag is saying “go up one directory, to Dasmoto, then go to `/css/style.css”.
If you’re working on your PC using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, one useful feature to test your links is that they are clickable within the editor to test them:

If the path is valid, the “follow link” feature opens the file in the editor. If the path is off, I get an error and VSCode asks me if I want to create that file. 
Hopefully this will be of some help to those of you struggling with the paths. 

Thanks for your help @8-bitgaming and @thepitycoder - really useful advice there and thanks for the explanation as well!
I found that my css file linked directly by including the full file path right to the hard drive, as well as using a double-period - thanks!

Long path tool can solve your problem easily. It can delete, copy, move and bulk rename long path files or locked file easily. Try it, It is very useful.  - ( Tom Murphy )

I suggest you try Long path tool is the very good program for easily delete, copy & rename long path files, error, unlock solution.Try it and solve your problem. - ( Tom Murphy )

Thank you! I was looking for the answer everywhere what’s wrong with my “…Images/pattern.jpeg”, and I just missing one “/” before the “images”, omg =))) Thank’s

i had a similar issue, if you set up your “structure” the way the video told you to set it up you need to use something like the following:
background-image: url(""…/…/resources/images/pattern.jpeg"");
more than anything check to see where your images are relative to your .css file.

I had the same problem but with a little time and fiddling I found a relative path that would work on  VS Code but the only problem is I do not understand why it works while the others do not.
2020-06-15 (1)_LI2313×728 248 KB
The blue circled relative path works but the red bracketed relative path does not. It should be noted that I used VS Code’s “copy relative path” and “copy path” in the beginning and they did not work.
Copy Path(did not work): C:\Projects\CodeAcademy\Dasmoto’sArts&Crafts\css\resources\images\pattern.jpeg
Copy Relative Path(did not work): css\resources\images\pattern.jpeg
The One(did work):  resources/images/pattern.jpeg
I also tried them all in Html and it seems to work in reverse. The One did not work but the others did.
For me its nice to know it finally worked but I really need to know why it did and why the others did not, for future projects down the line.

Welcome to the forums, @teraninja31546



 teraninja31546:

Copy Path(did not work): C:\Projects\CodeAcademy\Dasmoto’sArts&Crafts\css\resources\images\pattern.jpeg


This kind of absolute path should, generally speaking, be avoided. (For one, it makes your code less portable.)



 teraninja31546:

Copy Relative Path(did not work): css\resources\images\pattern.jpeg


Your path is invalid. Taking Dasmoto as the “root” directory, the path you’re trying to use here will - from the perspective of your CSS file - be attempting to find the following:
dasmoto/css/css/resources/images/pattern.jpeg
There is no css directory within the css directory, so the path is invalid.



 teraninja31546:

The One(did work): resources/images/pattern.jpeg


You’ve corrected your error from the previous attempt. Relative to the css directory, which is where your CSS file lives, this path is correct.

Hey there! Welcome to the forums 
Did you try refreshing the page after you wrote your CSS rules? Whenever I alter my CSS file I have to reload the page, otherwise I won’t see any changes.
I hope this helped!

I had this issue too. You want the text-align property to be applied to door-row, not door-frame, as you wish to center the contents of door-row (ie. the three doors) not the contents of each frame. That should fix your issue! Also be sure to give door-frame display.inline if you want the doors next to each other rather than stacked.

63,Difference between <strong> and font-weight: bold;,"Get Help,CSS","learn-typography,general",4,"
so why is there both? in html you can have  i am  bold.
so is font-weight: bold; in css just another way to do it?
        ","
Hello @giga4349672881. The <strong> tags are used for certain words within a <p> or other text tag. You could as easily use a <span> tag, and style that, but that takes more space.

Changing the font-weight to bold just affects how the text looks in the browser. Using <strong> gives syntactic significance to the text such that screen readers and web scrapers can use to understand which text is important.

<strong/> and <em/> give an aural indication, or change of voice to enclosed text. This is semantic emphasis.
<b/> and <i/> give visual indication only, and will not give a change of voice. Sometimes we just want to visually separate font-style from the norm, without adding any emphasis to the text.
When all we want is bold text, or italic text, without any aural emphasis, then use CSS, or the latter two tags. Always think of the person on the other side of the screen reader. If we emphasize too much it will come across as being yelled at and the user may leave the page.
Think in terms of accessibility when choosing markup.

You can try changing the colors and set outline on each element to see how the page is interpreting them. That way you can pinpoint if what you want is happening.
For example: if you don’t want you body content to have minimum proportions that don’t get distorted you can see if your css is doing that this way, and exactly how it’s not (this in turn, let’s you add specificity to your question for yourself and for others and gets you closer to your goal).
When you do this, I also highly recommend using the firefox browser and use the element picker (in inspect element: com+opt+c, or com+shift+c, or the mouse over window button on the top left of the console). This can not only highlight your element, but when it has errors you can click on the css to direct you to the relevant mdn documentation which is super clear.
As a bonus tip, I recommend Kevin Powell’s youtube channel on css as I find he has an incredibly clear way of explaining topics that I haven’t seen in other places.

Note, there’s a difference between setting outline and border, border actually changes the size, so for debugging outline is better.

Thank you. I’ll have a go at what you suggested and get back to you. 

The fixed position property is always relative to the view port of the window.

Hello @giga4349672881, could you please post your code, a link to the exercise, and the browser you’re using?

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-grid-i/exercises/review i tried several things. one was ‘grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;’ . i was stuck on number 3. browser  Safari 13.1 on macOS (Catalina)

i am not certain that ‘grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;’ was what i used as i asked for the solution and it erased my code. however i am 99% certain that was what i had

Could you retry the exercise, putting grid-template-rows: 200px 200px, and see if it still is a problem? When I try it with grid-template-rows: 200px 200px it does work:Screen Shot 2020-06-13 at 15.29.54964×399 58.4 KB

yes it worked this time. funny. well it appears that ive wasted your time and i am sorry.

It’s ok! It’s better to not have a bug than to have found a bug! (In future, if you find a bug, there’s the bug reporting sub category in community.)

This is not an exercise, but a playground. Until you can draw the connection between the layout of the example and the nodes that are given in the HTML, along with their CSS, the only obvious thing to do is go back to the beginning and possess one’s self of the core concepts in both HTML tables and Bootstrap’s implementation of them. We cannot throw a blanket over that. It must be covered, and clear in one’s mind.

69,CSS Grid Layout percentage didn't work well,"Get Help,CSS",,17,"
Hi, I’ve just found some problems with my CSS grid project: pup spa.
Unlike the video, my grid which had a value of percentage didn’t work well.
And I’ve found this update: Update behavior of CSS Grid Layout percentage row tracks and gutters(https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6708326821789696)
Because of that update, my gird didn’t work. What should I do solve this problem?
I think specifying the intrinsic height and width is the solution for this. Is it right?
Then, How can I set up this for responsive design? Should I set up a fixed value whenever I use percentage gird?
Here is my code.

I’m having the same problem. The project is not possible to finish because the row percentages mess it all up, and for a beginner it’s hard to figure it out.
I tried changing the row percentages to fractions, and for a couple of steps it worked (made the result match the one in the video), but it quickly became messed up again.
Please, update the steps to the project, or provide some of information in the course on how to deal with this.
Thank you.

Could you show me what it looks like currently and what it should look like?
I haven’t looked in depth, but it looks like the problem is that you now need to specify the height. I’m not sure exactly what is wrong with your code.

Sadly, I cannot do that anymore. I had access to the exercise as part of the Pro Trial, which has already ended.
In the video, the adjusted grid (in the first few steps) looked squished and strecthed, but it had a clear structure. What happened to my grid, was that it got distorted and some of the information got lost during the shifting. At first I thought that it was some fault in my code, so I restarted the exercise and tried following the video, but the result was the same, and did not look like the video.
I’ll come back to the exercise once I get the Pro Membership, but for now, that’s all I the info I can tell you.
Hope this helps.

I also had a similar problem. My grid layout seemed ok, but a lot of the alignment was off, empty space where it shouldn’t have been, dog image mostly hidden in the “desktop” view etc.
I checked my code with the video, and that confirmed it was correct in terms of what the task instructions required. However, what was displayed on my screen was different to the video. Also, the video was pretty rushed and didn’t even show the full-screen “desktop” view, only the “mobile” view. And the amendment made to add rows to the grid-template-rows declaration for the @media query was different in the video to the code given in the hint for task 11 of the project.
As my overall grid layout seemed ok, I’ve adjusted the following, and ended up with a much more satisfactory result:

% height of rows in both grid-template declarations (i.e. for both “desktop” and “mobile” views)
font-size for various elements;

max-width property for the dog image;
padding for various elements;
width and height values for the .marker, .clock and .phone class selector rules. The HTML class value was also wrong for the telephone image - so I changed this as well from class=""clock"" to class=""phone"".

I’ve also added the following grid-area declarations to the @media query, and this has corrected the unaligned width of some rows in the “mobile” view, and removed the horizontal scroll bar which was a consequence of this.
header {
    grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;
}

.banner {
    grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 2;
}

.about {
    grid-area: 3 / 1 / 4 / 2;
}

footer {
    grid-area: 9 / 1 / 10 / 2;
}

I just did this project today and encountered the same problem. After searching and finding this post, I added “height: 1200px” to the grid, and it worked. Not sure what I did is right, hope someone could give some explanations and suggestions.

I just “finished” this project and am having the same problems. Not really sure how to fix it.

Just did it, still functioning strange. Pretty sure what I did is not correct since it’s over 100%, but for the desktop version, I changed the grid-template row percentages to:
grid-template: 5% 60% 11% 15% 20% 0.5% / repeat(6, 1fr);

And it works perfectly!
I may check back here in the future, but for now moving on.

Just a shot in the dark, I haven’t loaded your code, but if percentage doesn’t work anymore, and you want responsive sizing of grid, maybe try the viewport units?
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp
1 vh or 1 vh == 1% of horiz or vert viewport respectively.
Maybe grid will respond better to those units.

I’m having a similar issue with this one. I changed the row heights to 5% 30% 20% 20% 20% 5% and that seemed to get the desktop version pretty close to what it is supposed to look like. The mobile version is still messed up for me though. Just seems like there is something off in the sizing of the rows.

Not sure if you guys figured it out by now, but the issue is actually with the image. I got around it by changing the image properties in the style.css to:
img {
height: 25%;
width: 25%;
}

It is frustrating, I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out the error in my code compared to the exercise, and there are not errors!
Surely codeacademy should amend this exercise as there will be beginner students like me who won´t know how to solve this problem.

Mhm same, I encountered the same problem and went through the videos a lot of times, but there was nothing wrong with the code.

There are some changes on CSS Grid Layout in percentages and indefinite height.
To keep the old behavior you just need to do the following for grid containers with indefinite height:
Change percentages in grid-template-rows to auto (desktop and mobile).
Add grid-row-gap: 20px; (desktop).
Remove margin-bottom: -20px; from header, .banner, .about
Remove margin-top: -20px; from footer (mobile).
Add grid-column: 1 / span 1; for the header, .banner, .about, and footer (mobile).
Here is my code.

I’m doing the Tea Cozy project in the “Layout With Flexbox”  The Flexbox is a little intimidating. Is this something I should be spending a lot of time on,  or should I just reference it as I go along?

Flexbox is undoubtedly a helpful tool in styling your websites.  It’s absolutely worth it to learn (even if it’s intimidating at first).  Here are some resources to help you out:


CSS Tricks has a really great and very comprehensive guide to Flexbox.  It serves as an awesome quick reference page for those times you forget how exactly a particular part of it works, but is also able to teach the concepts really well, preparing you to effectively make use of the tools provided for you.


Flexbox Froggy is a fun little free game created by codepip.  With multicolored frogs and lillypads as your guide, you are able to practice with a some of the common Flexbox elements in a low-stress, “gamey” environment.  It lets you work through the problems in your own time, greatly reducing the intimidation factor (because really… how can you be intimidated by those huge eyes).


The MDN Web Docs do a pretty good job of explaining Flexbox in basic tutorial style, but do very little to quell your nerves.  Come here last.


Best of luck!


I also like Kevin Powell’s videos on CSS a lot, very concise and has a good way of making it clear why certain things can be useful and in what context (https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb)

Of course I’m going to learn it, I’m wondering if its something I need to memorize right now, I’m moving on, I don’t want to get too hung up on a particular lesson. I don’t have a lot of time left on my pro membership, so I’m streamlining and making notes as I go. Thank you.

Great, thank you.  I remember someone suggesting not getting hung up on memorizing all the code, rather to focus on learning the concepts.

Hi there.
In your CSS, center is not a valid value for the margin: property. You can specify a length (10px), a percentage (5%), or auto. 

Nice, thank you. But the text is still more to the left. If I adjust margin valid values,  it doest work. Even If i can adjust and get a valid space from the left corner of the screen, the same space is also applied to the right side, more the space that is already there. Would you tell me how can i finally center the text, please?
Thank you.

I am having a problem with the background-image CSS property. I am using a relative file path. This is my file tree:

This is my CSS code:
#title{

  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: darkkhaki wavy underline;
  font-size: 100px;
  background-image: url(./recources/images/pattern-background.jpeg);
}

For some reason, the background image does not appear behind the text with the “title” id. I also tried the file path without the dot in front of the slash. Can anyone help?
Thanks,
Shane

You are making the relative file path reference to something inside ./ (which in this case is /recources/css).  Try ../images/pattern-background.jpeg (which, from the root, looks like /recources/images/pattern-background.jpeg).
And in case you were being picky about spelling… Should be “resources”, not “recources”.

Thanks @825orion! I’ll try that.

I tried, with no sucesso, to make some changes to the project available on the link above.
First, I would like the li itens on the nav to stay half way of the available space for them, but they are always more close to the bottom. look here:
111911×388 38.6 KB
the css code of the header is:
header {
  background-color: #333333;
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 10;
…  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 12px;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 80px;
  top: 80px;
}

The only way I could figure  out was to set posit margin-top to -20. But isnt it weird to use the minus sign? I guess there is something I am missing.
Also, I tried to make the footer fixed, but it vanished, even after fixing the z-index parameter to 10.
here is the footer css:
footer {
  background-color: #333;

  padding: 30px 0;

doesn’t the editor give a red dot on the side telling you what the problem is?
seems it doesn’t. Strange. Anyway, you use a colon after 32px, this should be a semi-colon.

Ehy thank you so much, this solved the problem!
I’m writing the code on atom not on Codecademy that must be why 

Atom should be better then a web-based IDE to display this kind of errors
you also have padding right, which is not correct. All css properties are “one word”, or have hyphens in the words

Hi guys, I’ve been trying to make alphabet cards with flipping cards but I still have a problem.
When hove the elements of the front face are still showing.

77,Practicing Grid and Ran into an Issue with # of Rows:,"Get Help,CSS","learn-grid,general",1,"
My original code, focus here is on the CSS rule for .grid:
.grid {
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: grid;
  height: 2000px;
  width:  1000px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr 50% 3fr 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 60% 1fr;
}

.grid div{
  background-color: hsla(60, 90%, 90%, 0.75);
  border: 1px solid blue;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

/* Grid rows: */

.a {
grid-column: 1 / span 4;
}

.b {
grid-column: 1 / span 4;
}

.f {
grid-column: 1 / span 4;
}

/* Grid Columns:*/

.c {
grid-row: 3 / span 2;
}

.d {
grid-row: 3 / span 2;
}

.e {
grid-row: 3 / span 2;
}


Okay, so I originally only wanted four rows: a, b, f, and the row of columns inbetween. My Original code was this:
.grid {
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: grid;
  height: 2000px;
  width:  1000px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr 50% 1fr;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 60% 1fr;

However, no matter how I adjusted the fourth row (1fr, 5fr, 500px, etc) it did nothing to the webpage. The f row stayed stuck at the bottom with no height and wasn’t getting any larger or smaller. I got a weird idea that there might be more rows and I should add one (not sure where this idea came from as the webpage only renders 3 rows and a 4th row of columns which I am assuming also counts as a row (please correct me if I am wrong)) and it worked! I was then able to adjust the height of the F row, which I had originally assumed was the fourth row but apparently is the fifth (? how is there five rows??). The problem is I have no idea why this worked. This resulted in the code that I posted at the beginning. But why did my original code not work? Why are there 5 rows and not 4? Also, is a row of columns also considered a row? If not then there are two rows I cannot see and I dont know where they are coming from. Im so confused on why this worked or why there are apparently more than 4 rows, one  (or two if a row of columns doesnt count as one of the rows) of which I cannot see.

.mission{

    max-width: 1200px;
}

#mission{
    text-align: center;
    background: black;
    padding: 10px;
}

So I’m trying to make the div with class .mission contract and expand to a maximum of 1200px. the problem is that it stops at around 1000 px and i don’t understand what i have missed.
","
It could be the fact that height is set to 700 px.
Since it has a picture, in order for it to expand to 1200, it may need to expand upwards.
Out of curiosity, how do you know how far it expanded to?
Did you compare it to an element that was set at 1200 px?

The picture dosen’t decide the size of the container.
I checked with the dev tools in Chrome 

I just typed out your code, and compared it with a bar that I set to be 1200px long, and they are both the exact same length.
The only difference in my code was that I do not have access to you picture, so I had to use a border to tell were the edges were.

What are you comparing your image to, in order to tell that it is stopping at about 1000 px?

I just resize the window.

That is not always a accurate way to measure, 1200 px will not always go across the entire screen.
I would recommend doing something like this at the bottom of your code and see if they are the same length:
<div class=""bar"">
</div>

Then style it with CSS:
.bar {
    height: 20px;
    width: 1200px;
    border: 2px solid green;
}

This should make a green bar at the bottom of your page, you can then see if it is the same length as your picture.




 8-bitgaming:

.bar {
    height: 20px;
    width: 1200px;
    border: 2px solid green;
}



Done and they aren’t the same

If it is not caused by the picture, perhaps it has to do with something farther back in your code, like a parent <div> element that is set to a width of 1000px.

I don’t have any other divs with hard coded widths before it.


Could you post your full code? Perhaps it is something else.

SURE!

here you go 

It is being caused by something inherited from <div class=""container"">.
I am not certain what yet but I am still experimenting.
You can test this by removing the container class. If you take that away it should be able to expand to the full size.

It is because of the align-items: center; in <div class=""container"">
I believe since it is aligning all elements inside of it to the center than there is no reason for the picture to expand farther, since the elements it contains already fit inside of it.

I don’t think it’s the img. If i try to remove the picture and put a color instead it dosen’t change.

I don’t believe it is because of the img. It is because of the align-items: center; in your <div class=""container"">

but how would you els center the content? div body div?

You can build a grid: display: grid; with a single column and five rows, in .mission
Then have #mission span row 3:

.mission {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  height: 700px;
  max-width: 1200px;
}

#mission {
  grid-row-start: 3;
  grid-row-end: 4;
  text-align: center;
  background: black;
  padding: 10px 50px;
  max-width: 1200px;
}



I found the problem. turns out i forgot to set the margin to auto. Now everything works.
Thank you for the help 

If you don’t mind me asking, how did you user margin: auto; to solve the problem?
I had tried that a number of times, before posting a my last reply, and it did not work.

column grid solution1003×830 29 KB

Hi there,
I’m having the same issue as leandrobongiorno447 above.  I’m not clear on how explicit rows are defined.
I understand they need to be explicitly defined, but how?
Are they defined in the HTML when they are manually inserted? E.g.
<div class=""box"">A</div>
<div class=""box"">B</div>
<div class=""box"">C</div>
<div class=""box"">D</div>

If I want to explicitly add another box to the above I would do this with ‘E’?
<div class=""box"">A</div>
<div class=""box"">B</div>
<div class=""box"">C</div>
<div class=""box"">D</div>
<div class=""box"">E</div>

Or do they need to be explicitly defined in the CSS as part of grid-template? Or both?
These questions in the multiple choice seem to give contradictory answers.
The first answer says it would be explicit, the second answer says it would be implicit.

question-1-box-would-be-explicit2880×1672 348 KB
 
question-2-box-would-be-implicit?2880×1676 350 KB

Thanks so much for your help, I am verrrrry new to this and want to make sure I understand this concept right! 

@leandrobongiorno4407, I think the grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px); is the answer.
If you look in the very bottom of your screenshot, you can see ""The new box will still be in one of the explicitly defined columns, which are 100px each.
The grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px); says 2 100px columns, so I think that’s the case.

@leandrobongiorno4407 and @nataliegerman, there is a article explaining Explicit and Implicit Grids, I encourage you to check it out.
Happy Web Developing! 

Thanks so much for your help on this @animatedcoder!! 

No problem, happy to help! 

Sorry to jump on this one but quick follow-up!

Given the questions both ask the same thing, “if we added a fifth box to the html” how would we know if it’s explicit or implicit?
Or do we just assume that because they ask, ‘what height would it have’ that we assume the CSS includes but does not mention here: ‘grid-auto-flow: column’?

I can’t distinguish if I don’ t understand the concept or it’s just confusion because of wording to the questions.

The padding-top is to move the links down away from the top of the window, but I don’t know whether you’d want the links there or somewhere else.

Thank you so much thepitycoder. I keep forgetting that float can be used in conjunction with grid stuff, and I should probably remember that you can also use flexbox with grid, though I don’t think I’m at quite that level of sophistication or experience yet. 

No problem.
I’m not entirely sure whether float would be the best way to do it, but it’s certainly a way to do it. 
Can always revisit if it breaks something further down the line as you carry on building your site; which, I must say, looks pretty sharp.

85,Don't understand why this is wrong? Does padding work like I described?,"Get Help,CSS","box-model,general",5,"
image3908×1454 492 KB
Essentially, I am confused about padding.
#teal {
background-color: #A8D0DB;
padding: 0 50px;
margin: 100px;
}
#purple {
background-color: #414073;
padding: 50px;
margin: 50px 100px;
}
The above is the solution. So I am wondering does a padding of say 50px 0px mean 50px is applied to both top and bottom (giving 100px overall) or 50px combined?
I am so bad at coding that I don’t know how to test this out. Thanks to anyone that can help 
","
Hello @board1774168228. From what I can remember, when you have a rule like:
padding: 10px 102px;

The 10px is for the top and bottom, and the 102px is for the right and left. Here is some reading about padding.
I hope this helps!

I believe it applies to both top and bottom…

Yes, as @codeneutrino and @8-bitgaming have said, the padding property in this instance works like this:
/* padding with a single value
   all sides receive same padding */
padding: 25px;

/* padding with two values
   first value is top/bottom, second value left/right */
padding: 25px 15px;

/* padding with four values
   each value is a different side, clockwise from top
   so: 5px top, 10px right, 15px bottom, and 20px left  */
padding: 5px 10px 15px 20px;

Remember as well that padding is spacing inside the element - it makes the element’s box larger - whereas margin is spacing around the element, increasing the “gap” between it and it’s sibling elements.
If you now understand how to correctly apply padding, I would encourage you to reset that exercise and re-attempt it yourself.

Are there better rules of thumb or strategies that you use to keep your HTML/CSS docs more condensed? As I inspect random sites with Chrome Dev Tools, the CSS looks a lot more condensed as they merge different features together in rules, however, does that make it easier to manage or worse given it’s not in the same sequential order as the site and html (as you scroll down).

Hello @dtseng10. Overall, I really like the look and layout of this website that you’ve created.

1) DESKTOP: In the “Start Learning” Section of the site with highlighted subject blocks. As I change the size of the browser, the text tends to extend outside of the div, even if I have padding added or not. What’s the best way to resolve that issue?


Well. I think I’ve found a solution, and I can point to you to some articles, but I can’t say that I know exactly what’s going on. The main rule that I found to work was overflow-wrap. It seems this deals with the way text wraps within its parent element. I set this to word-break, and with a few other tweaks, the problem seemed to go away.


Tweaks-I shouldn't think these made a difference, but I'll say them-don't look unless my above suggestion didn't work
I removed the padding in the media query for the parent element of the text, however that may not be required. I also set the text-align to left, but that almost certainly didn’t do anything. I also removed the padding rule from the .subjects-block-txt, which seemed to have a great effect. I think this is because this, combined with the overflow-wrap made the text go to the edge of the container, and then break, but again, it maybe just be coincidence.

As for question 2, I’m not quite sure what you mean by that, as I can’t notice anything (sorry if there’s something obvious that I’m missing).
As for number three, I think it is up to personal choice, and the requirements of the site. However, I’m not in any way a developer, so that is completely my opinion.
I hope some of this has been some help!

88,Link internally to a background-image,"Get Help,CSS",general,9,"
Good evening, all!
I’m wrapping up an introductory HTML/CSS project, and am having trouble linking a div’s background-image to an internal file (it works perfectly when I use an external URL).
Here’s where the pattern.jpg file is stored within the project:

Here’s the HTML:
<div class=""banner"">
      <header>
        <h1>Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts</h1>
      </header>
    </div>

Here are the two versions of the CSS styling that I tried that didn’t work.
Version 1:
.banner {
  background-image: url(""./resources/images/pattern.jpg"");
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}

Version 2:
.banner {
  background-image: url(""/resources/images/pattern.jpg"");
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}

What am I missing here? Thanks in advance for the help!

Hey, your link to the image should be in relation to where your CSS file is stored. In this case, one folder back and then towards the proper folder.
../ gets one you folder back to the project folder
resources/images gets you in the right direction.
background-image: url(""../resources/images/pattern.jpg"");





 anthonyverducci:

url(""/resources/images/pattern.jpg"")


On your local machine that URL points to the volume root, likely C:\. Use a relative URL as @janneslohmeijer illustrated to access your site folders from within the index.html or style.css files. This makes migration of files much simpler.




 janneslohmeijer:

../ gets one you folder back to the project folder


Fantastic! Does the same logic apply for navigating:
.../ three folders back
..../ four folders back
etc.?




 anthonyverducci:

Does the same logic apply for navigating:


./folder/file      =>  same directory
../folder/file     =>  one level up
../../folder/file  =>  two levels up


Hey, I’m also having problems with this same exact thing. I even copied the relative path directly from the pattern.jpg on the left side of VS Code, pasted it onto the css code and nothing. Can someone tell me what i did wrong? I’d appreciate the help!

.title{
background-image: url(""./images/pattern.jpeg"");
font-family: helvetica;
font-size: 100px;
font-weight: bold;
color: khaki;
text-align: center;
}

html:
<div>
        <header>
    <h1 class=""title"">Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts</h1>
    </header>
</div>

EDIT: I looked opened the DOM(?) on the Codecademy lesson page and coped the link from the image used on the example site, which finally worked. I just don’t understand why my link didnt work?

Hmm. How did you structure your files in this project, @dev4989176394?

Hi, I have a similar problem (only actual URL is working, but no local file):
.Top_title {
font-family: Helvetica;
font-size: 100px;
font-weight: bold;
color: khaki;
text-align: center;
/*(VSC) Path or relative path did not work - What's the problem?:  */
background-image: url(""C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Coding\DevProject\Dasmoto_Arts_Crafts\resources\Photos\pattern.jpeg"");
background-image: url(""Dasmoto_Arts_Crafts\resources\Photos\pattern.jpeg"");
background-image: url(""../resources/Photos/pattern.jpg"");

}
P.S. index.css is stored at “C:\Users\Marius\Desktop\Coding\DevProject\Dasmoto_Arts_Crafts\resources\css\index.css”

Thank you, because of your information, I could solve my problem.

89,Responsive image isn't responsive,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,5,"
Good morning,
If you look at www.markallanholley.com, you’ll notice that the robot-girl image on the right isn’t responsive at all. I’ve coded what I thought was a correct way to deal with it, but I’m having no luck whatsoever. I was wondering if someone would take a look.
I’m absolutely sure that the CSS is correctly targeting the HTML because I did a little test by changing the background color to green and the background turned green. Then I erased that green line of code.
HTML:
<section class=""rightsection"">

			 <figure>
			 	<img src=""../links/notarobot.jpg"" alt=""Sad robot looking at computer.""  class=""responsive""> 
			 	<figcaption>""Not A Robot"" 2019, Blender, Photoshop</figcaption>
			</figure>

			</section>

CSS:
.responsive {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

This is the site:
www.markallanholley.com
The image in question is the one to the far right. Any assistance appreciated.

Hey there,
It’s showing as responsive on my browser. Did you fix the problem?

I did. I just fixed it a few minutes ago and forgot to update my post here. Thank you for looking into it toastedpitabread. 

Just curious, what was the fix?? 

It was just changing:
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(1fr, 10px, 1fr));
to
grid-template-columns: 1fr 10px 1fr;
Apparently, I was overthinking it.

Hello @ruby9951660504, from just looking through your code, you’ve used static measurements (not sure if that’s the correct word for them), like px. If you used a measurement like em, which are proportional to the size of the size of the browser window, that might help solve your issue. Here is an article explaining rem, em and px. Not to say to follow it to the letter, but it gives a good indication of the relative measurements.
I hope this helps!

Hello again. I just found another website which explains em, rem, and px; it might be less subjective than the first one I mentioned.

Thanks for those two articles. I changed my measurements throughout CSS to rem, however that did not solve the problem. The best solution I’ve come up with is to set the services images to overflow: hidden and the staff images to nowrap, this prevents images from either gallery from overlapping with any other elements.
However I am still curious on how to implement the code in the solution, in which the gallery images shift from a row to column as the browser resizes.
This is the latest version of my code:

Hello @ruby9951660504. I may be mistaken, but is some of the solution code using media queries? If so, then they allow you to re-write some CSS code, if the screen size is lowered:
@media only screen and (max-width:/*certain width*/){
/*re-written code goes here*/
}

I hope this helps!

Hi @codeneutrino, the solution code does not use media queries, it only uses flexbox.
I also tried making another website, and implementing line for line the same HTML and CSS rules as the solution. This did make it so the first set of gallery images (food) did not overlap with the  second gallery images (team), but the team images stayed in a column even when the screen was wide enough to allow them to spread out in a row. Unlike in the solution code where they go from being a row to a column as the browser resizes.
Here is my second website:

91,Flexbox - inline-flex,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",5,"

Would somebody please be able to help me understand why ‘‘inline-flex’’ is declared on the items instead of the container?
Thanks in advance! 
","
Hello @core9017156070 and welcome to the forums 
If you declare inline-flex on the container instead of the items, than it will effect anything  with a class of container. As such all of the containers will be stacked accordingly.
They want items inside the container to be stacked instead of the containers to be stacked.
Try visualizing the class=""container"" as two chests, and the class=""child"" as blocks inside the chests.
If we declare display: inline-flex; on the container than the two chests will be effected, but their contents will not change.
If we declare display: inline-flex; on the child than the items inside the chest will be effected.
You can see this effect by changing your code and testing it.

Thanks do much for your help! I am still a bit confused .
-I can’t wrap my head around imagining one container as TWO chests?
-what do you mean by stack? like side by side, which is what inline is supposed to do, or top and bottom?

This is what happens if I try to type it up , the two child elements (blue border) are not going inline?
also, if i change the child elements’ width to 500px each, their blue borders just expand beyond the parent container (red border)? I thought the child items are meant to shrink to fit inside the parent? (the child elements do shrink though if I put display: inline-flex in the parent, .container?).
Sorry for all the questions!! I really appreciate your help! .

Sorry for not being clearer, take this code:
<div class=""container"">
    <div class=""child"">
        <h1>1</h1>
        <h1>2</h1>
    </div>
</div>

<div class=""container"">
    <div class=""child"">
        <h1>1</h1>
        <h1>2</h1>
    </div>
</div>


If you call inline-flex on container, than anything with the name container will be stacked according to inline-flex, which is all good if you are wanting to modify multiple elements with the class of container.
However you are trying to modify the elements with a class of child



 core9017156070:

like side by side, which is what inline is supposed to do, or top and bottom?


I recommend reading the documentation for this display value. I actually just reviewed this and its behavior is different compared to what I previously thought:



MDN Web Docs



Flex
flex is a new value added to the CSS display property. Along with inline-flex it causes the element that it applies to to become a flex container, and the element's children to each become a flex item. The items then participate in flex layout, and...








 core9017156070:

also, if i change the child elements’ width to 500px each, their blue borders just expand beyond the parent container


I believe that the visual of an element can expand past the border of its parent, however other elements will ignore its presence and they may overlap. I could be wrong about this though, I will test it when I get the chance and let you know.

No need to apologize, I will do what I can to help.

It seems this is the case, as the elements will overlap each other, when their parents border each other but the child element’s width goes farther than the parent.

93,Aligning Messed Up When Fixing Navigation bar to specific location,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,3,"
Hello, I am having problems with my navigation bar formatting.  Currently, my HTML code is as follows:
<div class=""header"">
            <img class=""logo"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-logo.png""> 
            <ul>
                <li>Mission</li>
                <li>Featured Tea</li>
                <li>Locations</li>
            </ul>          
        </div>

and my relevant CSS code is
.header {
    height: 69px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid seashell;
}
.logo {
    height: 50px;
    margin-left: 10px;
    
}

.header ul {
    color: white;
    float: right;


}
.header li {
    display: inline-block;   
    text-decoration: underline; 
    padding-right: 10px;
}

This allows my logo image to be left aligned in the nav bar and the list to be to the right, with a white border underneath.  However, when i add the position: fixed to my .header, I lose this formatting and everything groups toward the left.  Why could this be happening?
","
Hello @abhimanyd2001! Welcome to the forums!! 
I’m not entirely sure why fixed won’t work, I believe it is do to the fact that fixed will automaticly try to take up as little space as possible.
For the specific purpose of a page header you can use the sticky position:
.header {
position: sticky;
top: 10px;
}

This will allow the element to scroll with the page until it reaches a given point, in this example it is 10px from the top. Since it is already bordered with the top it won’t scroll with the rest of the page.
Hopefully this helps 

Hello, I am having the same problem right now, according to the specs the navigation bar should be fixed but then it’s impossible to use the flexbox to keep the logo on the left and the navigation list on the right… and using sticky doesn’t seem to work. I am tempted to just ignore the request to have the navigation fixed, but is there actually a possible solution???

94,The box model : height and width on browsers,"Get Help,CSS",box-model,3,"
Okay so when the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices. But what if the browser’s display was set to zoom in at 125%, will the element’s dimensions be affected?
","
It may vary between browsers, but I don’t believe it does.
Changing the zoom will change the size of the items on the page. When you are writing the HTML you are writing it as 100%
You can test this with something like this:
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            p {
                background-color: red;
                width: 50px;
                height: 50px;
            }
         </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p> Testing </p>
    </body>
    
</html>

You can then change your browser zoom level and watch the red square change.
You can use any element as your testing item, I just picked a <p> element.

Yes you were right.
Changing the browser didn’t affect the dimensions but changing the zoom did.
Thank you.

Hi there.
If I use your CSS, the page renders correctly for me. You’ve clicked the Save button on style.css to “commit” the changes and refresh the page, right?

Hello!
I thought I had, but maybe not. In any event, I ended up resetting the project and re-writing it again from scratch, and it is now rendering correctly. In the future, I will make sure to click the “Save” button often just in case.
Thanks!

98,Footer staying on bottom and links,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,6,"
I’m half way through the learn how to build websites course and have been battling with the Web Design System project.The trouble I had was the footer was half way up the page, despite the page being very long. I researched online only to find several methods such as Grid, Flexbox and negative margins.
Even though I may be jumping the gun, I decided to try Flexbox. I created a test page. It only works if I duplicate in the footer position:relative and top:100px which I have on main.
Would Flexbox be the way to go and is this a correct assumption?
Also, when linking to a different section of the page, it doesn’t reach it’s exact location. Only when I have all the positioning (fixed and relative) and top value removed it somehow reaches the destination. I have a link in footer to go  to first sentence.
How can I resolve the link going to the correct place?

From looking at your CSS, you’ve worked out how to have a header section stick to the top of your page. How can you apply this same method to have a footer stick to the bottom? 
(It doesn’t rely on flexbox, btw.)

I presume you’re referring to the anchor element <a href=""#top"">Home</a> which targets the fragment with ID top?
I’m also guessing that your problem is that where you’re wanting the page to scroll to ends up behind your fixed header?

When I created a position: fixed for my header, I realised it behaves like absolute with my content below  partially being covered up. Hence, creating position:relative and top:100px for my main tag.
I wanted the footer to show up at the bottom as I scrolled down. Originally, I tried flexbox because the main content was covering the footer which wasn’t at the bottom. I’ve removed flexbox now, but kept the position:relative and top:100px in footer…and it works! 
Can I assume any main container with positioning values, you have to duplicate in the footer?

When I click on the link, it doesn’t reach as far up as desired. It goes to the next line of code down. It’s only when I experiment by removing the position:fixed in the header, the link goes exactly to where I expected it to.
I was wondering if this is because I have position:fixed in my header and possibly position:relative and top:100px in my main tag. If it is the case, what would you recommend to resolve this problem?




 jgokop:

When I created a position: fixed for my header, I realised it behaves like absolute with my content below partially being covered up. Hence, creating position:relative and top:100px for my main tag.


Yes, using position: fixed and a z-index: 1 results in your header being stuck to the top of the page and it displaying over the other content. Adding margin to the top of the obscured content is how I’d have fixed that. 



 jgokop:

I wanted the footer to show up at the bottom as I scrolled down


I’m not entirely sure what you mean here. If you mean you wanted it to appear at the bottom, so that it’s shown in the flow of the page as you arrive at the bottom, then that happens already with the code as it stands.
If you mean you wanted it stuck to the bottom, much like your header is stuck to the top, then you already know how to do that. (You’ve done it with your header already.)
If you mean something else, well, you’ll need to tell me what you mean.  (Feel free to wireframe the blocks of your site in Paint or something if that’ll make it clearer. )



 jgokop:

No, it goes to exactly where you’re telling it to.
Your #top fragment is the paragraph tag:
        <p id=""top"">This is a test first paragraph on this page.</p>

If I change your stylesheet to include opacity: 40% in the header ruleset, you can see where the anchor takes the page to when I click the link targeting the #top fragment:

image1031×394 11.4 KB

See how at the very top of the page, your paragraph is there? Normally, with the header section fully opaque, you would not be able to see it.



 jgokop:

I was wondering if this is because I have position:fixed in my header


Yes, I think so.
Clicking that anchor puts the targeted fragment right at the very top - behind the header section, which is statically fixed to the page.
Using the Dev Tools, I can see that your header element is roughly 80 pixels in height:

The problem that you need to work around is that, essentially, you need to add at least 80 pixels of margin to the location that your anchor is linking to.
We can do this with a bit of CSS, by using the ::before pseudo-element:
#top::before {
  display: block;
  content: "" "";
  margin-top: -100px;
  height: 100px;
  visibility: hidden;
}

What we’re doing with this CSS is creating a pseudo-element which exists in the flow of the page before the #top element, which is 100 pixels high. This effectively pushes the paragraph tag down by 100px, but that looks a bit weird… so the negative margin (of -100px) moves it back to where it originally would have been.
However, when we click the link, because we’ve created a ::before pseudo-element that is part of the #top element, it’s the top of this pseudo-element which gets hoisted to the top of the browser window. The actual paragraph of text remains visible, below the header section.
Here I have selected the p element with the ID #top; notice how it’s quite a bit larger than the paragraph element, which is still visible below the header (which is still at 40% opacity):

Hopefully that solves some of your problems!
If you’re still stuck with the footer, please let us know how it’s not doing what you want (and what it is that you want it to do) and we’ll try and help. 

Thank you @thepitycoder for a in depth reply. I now fully understand!

No worries. Let us know if you get stuck with anything else.

Why using position and top instead of just one line of code margin-top ?? is there any preference ?

margin is part of the box model, position and top are not. margin-top will affect the height of the box, where top is an offset that does not change the height of the box.
Note that both can be used in combination. An element can have both an offset and a margin, as long as we know what the margin applies to.

That was useful. Thanks.


Just a little confirmation … So it is preferred to use for such example and in general relative position and margin when i want to have spaces between boxes for example??





 saoud.ali:

So it is preferred


It is not about preference, only what makes sense in our layout. Web development is objective, not subjective. Creativity is subjective, but that relates to content, not structure.

Addendum
Say we have a banner of some height that is fixed. It makes sense to offset the normal flow content by that same amount. This way we don’t have to fudge with the margin. We could set the margin to what minor amount we want below the header, say 10 to 20 pixels. If we decide to hide the banner, we don’t have to fiddle with the margin, just toggle the top property.
For example,
#banner {
    display: block;
    position: fixed;
    height: 100px;
    background: url(banner.png);
}
#wrapper {
    position: relative;
    top: 100px;
}
header, footer {
    margin: 10px auto;
}
main {
    margin: 0 auto;
}

<body>
<div id=""banner""></banner>
<div id=""wrapper"">
  <header></header>
  <main></main>
  <footer></footer>
</div>
</body>

banner.onclick = toggle

The last one can be explored when you get to the scripting part of the course. Study the structure and the selectors and conceptualize.

Thanks a million for such explanation

I’m stuck on “Nested Elements” in CSS Tutorial (FAQ: Learn CSS Selectors Visual Rules - CSS Setup Selectors - Nested Elements).
The task is radically simple:

Navigate to  style.css . Add a selector that targets all of the  h5  elements nested inside elements with class  .description .
Inside the curly braces of the selector, write:
But compiler still objects my code insertion into style.css:
.description h5 {color: teal;}
with Error:
Did you write ‘color: teal’ inside the curly braces for the description h5 selector?

 marataya:

But compiler still objects


It’s actually the lesson checker, known as the SCT (Submission Correctness Test) that delivered that error message, not the interpreter/compiler.
It could be simply the pattern in how the selector rule is written.
.description h5 {
    color: teal;
}

vs.
.description h5 { color: teal; }

Try it and see if that solves things.

Tried all these:

.description h5 {
color:teal;
}

and

.description h5 {
color: teal;
}

and

.description h5 { color: teal; }

I still get the error ---- “Did you write ‘color: teal’ inside the curly braces for the description h5 selector?”
How do I resolve this?

This could be an issue with the lesson checker. @lilybird, any chance of getting this looked at?

102,Tea Cozy Project: why is the background image not displaying?,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",2,"
Good evening:
I’ve been stuck on this (https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/layout-with-flexbox/projects/tea-cozy) project because I have not been able to make the background image show like it’s supposed to.
In this link, you’ll find the design specs, where you will see how the “Our Mission” section should look like.
This is what my HTML looks like:
    <!-- MAIN -->
    <main>
        <!-- Mission -->
        <section id=""mission"">
            <div class=""mission-text"">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <h4>Handpicked, Artisanally Curated, Free Range, Sustainable, Small Batch, Fair Trade, Organic Tea</h4>
            </div>
        </section>

and this is the CSS I’ve come up with:
/* MISSION */
main {
    width: 1200px;
    padding: 69px;
    opacity: 0.9;
    margin: auto;
}

#mission {
    background-image: url(/Resources/images/img-mission-background.jpg);
    height: 700px;
    width: auto;
}
.mission-text {
    width: 100%;
    background-color: black;
}

I used the id selector for the section to set the background image, but it does not show up as expected. Could you help me figure out what I’m doing wrong?
Thank you!

Hello @chip8335305528!! Welcome to the forums 
Based on the code you posted it appears your url is not complete.



 chip8335305528:

background-image: url(/Resources/images/img-mission-background.jpg);


If you want to display a picture, you have to give it the full file path, such as this one taken from the HTML lessons.

Hi,
I completed the Cozy-tea project however on a wider screen the background images repeat. When I set the no-repeat rule on the images are no longer centered.
Any help would be great!

I am by no means an expert, but did you try doing
background-size: cover?
Or changing the background size at all?
I think you could also do…
height: 700px;
width: 100%
or something like that

104,Nested CSS Grid (strange behaviour),"Get Help,CSS",learn-grid,2,"
Hi I have been through your courses on HTML5 and CSS, and as advised have been playing around with some of the items covered.
I have been playing with CSS grid and have come across a problem. I’ve pastes the HTML and CSS files content below.
If you look at the nested grid in Firefox and look at the grid display you will see the four separate nested grids each with 1 row and 12 columns. However if you look at the CSS file you can only assign the element “main-services-text” “main-banner-text” etc by treating it as a single 4 row grid.
So my question is, is this the way it should work or is it a bug. And should I use it?

    Services

/* Step 1: create a SUB GRID to hold the main elements*/
.main-grid{
display: grid;
grid-template-columns:  repeat(12, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: 100px 100px 100px 100px ;
}
/* Step 1a assign the main elements “” to the MAIN Grid*/
.main-banner {
grid-column: 1 /13;
grid-row:  1 / 2;
background-color: cornflowerblue;
}
.main-services {
grid-column: 1 /13;
grid-row:  2 / 3;
background-color:lightcyan;

}
.main-who-are-we {
grid-column: 1 /13;
grid-row:  4 / 5;

}
/* Step 2: Set up individual nested GRIDS*/
main section {
display: grid;
color: olive;
grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: 100px;
}
/* Step 2 assign elements to the nested grids  */
.main-banner-text {
grid-column: 3 / 5;
grid-row: 1 / 2;
}
.main-services-text {
grid-column: 6 / 9;

106,"PX, EM or REM?","Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
I’m currently working on my own portfolio site and have had conflicting bits of information on best practice on how to size fonts . I have a friend who works in industry and has said he has never come across people using EM/REM previously and everything is done in PX.
Which should I get into the habit of using? Should I force myself to utilise rem whenever possible?
Thanks
","
I would say yes, if you use pixels for the font, when a person wants to configure it to have a larger one in its device, they won’t be able to.
What I usually do is to set the html to:
font-size: 62.5%
So every rem will be 10 pixels each, and you can calculate the pixels easily.

Hello @manojsoni007,
I’ve had a quick look at your css code and I can see that one of the media queries has an error:
@media only screen and (max-width:500)

You have not provided a unit value for the max-width property. This should be something like px, em, et cetera that sort of thing.
I’ve provided a link to the MDN documentation regarding media queries.



MDN Web Docs



Using media queries
Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).





For future reference, it would be helpful if you could post your code and maybe a screenshot of the project so we can better help you to fix your problem.
If you need anymore help, you know where the forum is.
Best wishes,
Richard.

Sure, below is the html/BS and CSS.

Thanks

button {
  outline: none;

Hi, I tried this but the border/outline still persists and nothing changes. Just to be clear, this only appears after the button has been clicked.
See below for the button before I click it, then after it is clicked.
Just to clarify, the button on the right is before, then the button on the left is after I click it.
Thanks
 

Alright, try
button,
button:active,
button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

Hopefully this will work

If you have tried it as the above, you might need to post all of your HTML/CSS as what you have written should work if you’re using quotation marks to hold your url.

Technically, quotation marks shouldn’t be needed.
The code works as expected:

Hello @design4985813316!! Welcome to the forums!! 
If I remember correctly, they were showing things like classes and ids.
If this is the case, for CSS to style something, it need an HTML element to work with, so they have you changing the HTML to specify which element will be styled.
One way to picture it would be CSS as paint. If a person wants their house painted but only tells the worker, “Go paint.” He has no clue what to paint. So giving HTML elements special attribute is like telling the man what to paint.
If this was not what you are reffering to let me know.
It could also have been that they were talking about inline styling, which is how you can keep your HTML and CSS in a single file. If so they were showing you multiple ways of styling, both have their own pros and cons.

Hi there, welcome to the forums!



 design4985813316:

Without a link to the specific exercise that you’re working on, it’s difficult to be sure, but…



 design4985813316:

Wouldn’t it make more sense to do all the styling in CSS?


If I remember correctly, the CSS lessons start off with some exercises where you style individual elements by doing something like this:
<p>This is some text and <span style=""text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 36px;"">this is some text I'd like larger and uppercase</span> compared to the rest of my paragraph</p>

which results in

image965×117 7.21 KB

(I’ve just put that paragraph element into an existing page I had, hence why it’s not the default black text on a white background).
The purpose of the early exercises getting you to style individual elements like this, is precisely to show you how cumbersome (and just how much work it would be) to define and maintain styles in this way.
As you progress, you will move away from inline styles - as I demonstrated above - and towards defining your CSS in a dedicated file and linking it to your HTML document.
You will, as @8-bitgaming has said, continue to rely on class and id attributes in your HTML though. These are used to allow you to be precise with which elements get which styles.

It could also have been that they were talking ab out inline styling, which is how you can keep your HTML and CSS in a single file. If so they were showing you multiple ways of styling, both have their own pros and cons.



issue got solved!!!

Out of curiosity, how did your quote of me end up with two links, to websites I never even mentioned? 

Not anymore… Links removed.

112,Dasmoto's CSS Background Image,"Get Help,CSS",general,37,"
Hi Everyone,
Like many others, I am having the damnedest time getting a background image to work for this project. I am using VS Code. Below are my HTML and CSS code. It will not work with relative nor absolute paths. The other CSS stylings are working just fine…this is all that won’t work. I looked through everything here and have been searching the Web for 2 hours now. It just wont work. Please help.
Since I’m a “new user” I can only upload one photo, so I have my HTML and CSS in the same file in the photo, but they are not that way when I am writing.

image1920×1080 236 KB

Bump. Still looking for help.

Be sure that the path is correct for the background image.
../images/pattern.jpeg

from what we can tell of your site structure.

I copied and pasted the absolute path directly from the panel on the left where it shows the image. It doesn’t work with relative or absolute path. I’m kind of at my wits end with it. I’ve tried all 4 images just in case it was a bad file for some reason. Nope…doesn’t work. I really don’t know what to do at this point. Very frustrating.

We cannot see your CSS. Please post so we can examine it.

D’oh! We can see it.
Okay, first thing to keep in mind is never writing Local Machine paths on your virtual website projects. Put them in a folder along with their resources, and base all URLs on that file structure.
Second thing to be in a habit of is writing http urls with forward slash.
Is there an image called pattern.jpeg somewhere? Is it the one to use in the background? You already have a paints.jpeg image in the view.

Also, please post the URL to this project so we can look at the provided resources (and the redline).

I believe mtf is correct in earlier post…CSS commented at the bottom of picture has incorrect relative path for the background image.
   ../images/pattern.jpeg

@ samurai
Yeah…I see that…that was before I changed the name of the image. Like I said, it doesn’t work with any of the images so the name of the file didn’t really matter, as it will not work with any of the images that are in the folder.

@ mtf
I don’t really understand what you’re saying to me in your last reply. It seems like it could be helpful, I just don’t understand. Can you break that down so I can understand as a newbie, please?
I’m just so confused why this isn’t working.

Here is the url for the project.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/local-website-development/projects/dasmoto
Does redline mean the solution? I am sorry if I ask basic questions, but I am still pretty new, so I don’t have a ton of background knowledge. I hope that this helps.




 daniel.murphy:

Does redline mean the solution?


Sort of. It is the specification of the document.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg


Last thing to mention, it DOES work when I use:
background-image: url(“https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/pattern.jpeg”);
in order to link to the image from the source on the Web…just cant get it to work when linking from my local folder.

That was going to be my next question, whether the CDN image works or not.
Because the pattern.jpeg image is only used as a CSS background, I would recommend putting it in the same folder as the style sheet.
+ resources/
    + css/
        + skins/
            - pattern.jpeg
        - style.css
    + images/

h1 {
    background-image: url(skins/pattern.jpeg);
}


Last ditch effort - I changed the """"s to ""/""s
AND IT WORKED…
Now, the real question is…WHY?

should say """"s to ""/""s

Why does it delete my backslashes in quotes?
I changed the backslashes to forward slashes…thats what I was trying to say.

The why is more difficult to explain than would be worth it. The wherefore would be that we are writing for the web so our operating system affords us the ability to use the HTTP prescribed path syntax when writing on the local machine. Down the road this course will likely have us working with a local server using actual HTTP URL to access and display in a browser.
We won’t go that far, thankfully. Just know that your local site should present with the same behavior as a web hosted site. The simplest way to do this is to structure the file folders to emulate that environment.
+ sites/
    + dasmotos/
        + resources/

… and so on.
It follows you may have parent folders to all this, the key parent being My Documents or perhaps, D:\. The latter case is the only one that will behave like a site root. That, too, is for another discussion.

OK. So the lesson that I have learned here is to use forward slashes in the code…even if I copy and paste and it wants me to use backslashes…change them to forward slashes.
Sound right?




 daniel.murphy:

Sound right?


Yes, as long as it is for the right reason. Think WWW. We want web behavior when writing and testing locally based sites. Not all can be emulated in the browser, though. We don’t have PHP on our machine. We don’t have Rails on our machine. We don’t have Node.js, Angular.js, React.js, etc. on our machine. Those are all taught as separate advanced learner courses we needn’t get into right now.
As a learner, we benefit from spending the most time possible on the native browser, lots with NO CSS, and tonnes with style sheets. The basics of writing and running code locally are not that hard to learn, as you have found, and are skills that we never forget if we deploy them on a regular basis. Practice, experiment, innovate.




 daniel.murphy:

Why does it delete my backslashes in quotes?


Backslash is an escape character. To have one appear as you want, escape it…
""\\""   => \

Escape characters permit us to render as printable any special character that would normally not render in text.

That makes sense. Thanks.
So does the explanation of using forward slashes for the right reasons. Thanks.

113,Text inside a <div> element - why doesn't it require a <p> element?,"Get Help,CSS",selectors-visual,3,"
In this lesson:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/intro-to-css/modules/learn-css-selectors-visual-rules/lessons/css-setup-selectors/exercises/nested-elements
I notice that the code sometimes uses division elements that have text inside the division element, but there are no paragraph tags.
Here is an example:
<div class=""description"">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

In this example, there is is no paragraph element. Is the  <p>/</p> implied here?
Thank you!
","
Hello @mega6951449831. The <p></p> are better to have, but I wouldn’t say they are implied in your situation. <div> tags will render any text that between it, just like it will render anything else between it.
I hope this helps!

Thank you very much. This explains it

Hello @jaredmonkman, I suppose the problem is that you haven’t specified what to do with the background image if it takes up too much space. You’ve set the background-repeat: no-repeat, you might have to use the overflow property. W3Schools article. Also, media queries are useful in this situation, although I’m not sure if you’ve done them.
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)/*or whatever you want it*/{
/*Rules for when this is met*/
/*eg:*/
h1 {
  font-family: serif;
}

I hope this helps!
}

Also note that in this case, <hr> having a fixed width of 960px will always remain at 960px even if you resize your browser window.
You could use @media queries, or relative units (like percentages).
@media (max-width: 960px) {
  hr {
    width: 100%
  }
}

That’s up to you.

116,Should I use one or more css files?,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
I’m on the web development track and thinking about creating my first project, but I have a question of what is best, should I have a css file for all my site pages or a css file for each page? How is the best way to organize it?
I learned on youtube that it is best to have a reset css in a file and use another file with my main css, but I think I could separate the main css file in other files so it is more readable.
Any thoughts about it?

Hello @lassekoivisto.



 lassekoivisto:

best to have a reset css in a file


Yes. This is a very good idea, as it allows you to reset any mistakes you make and so you can tell what the basis of the site should be like.



 lassekoivisto:

another file with my main css,


This is also a good idea, as it make the code more readable, and is therefore better than inline styling.
Should you use multiple files?
If you are purely concerned about making it easier for yourself, then I would say yes, however, more files increase the loading time, and means that you have to repeat a lot of rules, for example, if you wanted all headers to be blue, you would have to specify that in each file. One thing you could do is to  have a main.css file that contains most of the CSS. Then, if any pages warrant specific styling, that is different to the overall styles, then you could do a page for that one. But it is up to you how you organise your files.
I hope this helps!

gg1915×973 488 KB

","
Can you please paste your code?
It could be the padding property, but if I took a guess I think it is because of the font-size
I don’t think the text in its current size can line up perfectly. Since the word “Developer” doesn’t fit in the top line it has to be on a second line, and without it the top line doesn’t fill up the space in the top line. You could try using the letter-spacing , or word-spacing properties if you don’t want to change your font-size.
Hopefully this is helpful, happy coding 

Hi, unfortunately it’s not the font size, I did play around with this. Code is below, thanks:

Let me make sure I understand what you are trying to do.
If I understand correctly, you want the <h1> element to go from one edge of the blue rectangle in your picture to the other edge.
If this is the case than I don’t think it is possible given the size of the text, since the space taken up by one line is too much, and the space taken up by two lines is too little.
Did you try changing the space between words? You might be able to push the words closer to the edges this way.

One more question. If you resize your browser can you get it to line up correctly?

I am doing the fotomatic debug project to try and fix the code to look like this https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/solution/index.html
Re:the first element in header that is a class labelled logo I cannot move it to the left hand side of the page like the example. I have inspected the example ‘solution’ and cannot see any difference in the code. I thought about applying lots of padding to he right hand side of it but this code definitely isn’t in the solution.
How is it done?
I’ve tried a few things and nothing seems to work it just moves all of the elements in the header or does something crazy.
I would look it up but I don’t know what the term is to describe it. Is it related to display or position or something else?
I have attached images of what mine looks like and my html/css code and a link to the solution is above.

@manojsoni007, welcome to the forums!
From your screenshot, it actually looks like that relative path is not correct.  Remember, the path is relative to the file you are typing in.  It looks like your CSS file is in a folder called css, whose parent folder is resource.  You are trying to access an image that is not in the same folder, but rather in the image folder, which is also contained in the resource parent folder.
In order to access something in the image folder from a file in the css folder, your path first has to navigate back to the resource parent folder.
To do this, just use ../
If you can’t figure it out, click below to see the proper path:


Click here for code
../image/pattern.jpeg


No problem.  You might want to brush up on absolute vs. relative paths to avoid this problem in the future, as it’s a very simple fix once you wrap your head around the concepts.
Happy coding!

it’s working properly using your solution. but i don’t understand what was the problem. what mistake i had done in relative path and where i have to put all my media file?

/resource/image/pattern.jpeg looks for a directory named resource inside of the directory your css file is in, rather than looking for a parent directory named resource.
I’m sure Codecademy covers this in either the html or css course, but you can also just Google “absolute vs. relative path” and find plenty of articles and videos that go into more depth.

Hello @java7488985522, welcome to the forums. I haven’t as yet found the cause, however another thing you might want to look at is this



 java7488985522:

<p style=""text-align: right;""></footer></p>


You are opening the <p> inside the <footer>, however, you are closing the <footer> inside the <p>. You might want to rearrange that so the </footer> and </p> are in the order they opened.

Hey,
I shall amend that now. Hasn’t solved the other issue sadly, but good to know as I’m pretty new to this.
Thank-you!

Hello @java7488985522!! 
Perhaps it is obvious and I am missing it, but which image are you trying to float?
Your CSS does not include the float command.

<h1><img class=""header-image"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/Nj06vm2.gif"" alt=""Image"" height=""65"" width=""650"" align=""right""></h1>

Good morning :)! Please see the quote above where it says “align right” this is how it was previously set up and it was working.
(Isn’t included in this thread) but i have also tried on CSS
.header-image {
float: right;
}
Which sadly wont work either. I am going crazy.

Have you tried setting it to !important
Maybe your <h1> CSS is effecting it.
I actually don’t think it needs to be in an <h1> element since <h1> is only for text, and you don’t have anything except the image there.

So would I set it like this in CSS:
.header-image {
float: right !important;
}
If so, I just tried this and it hasn’t worked. I’ve also removed the

I’ve done the media query exercise, put in the right code (the box got checked and all) but media queries dealing with resolution don’t work on my computer.

Try
border: none;
instead of
border: 0px;
Hope this helps
Happy coding!

Can you explain what the difference is? I thought those 2 would do the same thing basically. 

It should not really be a difference.
But there is a theory to my thought:
It may be that even though the width of the border is set as 0 px, the browser might still render it. The border is existent but has no width.
Setting the border to none might solve this issue since the border now is non existent.
Let me know if this works @thibautrobin

Can we see your html code as well?

I’ve been thinking about this one 1px line since you posted the entry and I think I might have found something else you can try in the Resposive Design class on how to build websites. It was just a small detail, but it sure looked EXACTLY like your problem.
Try display:block instead of the default for the images (with should be display:inline-block). In the course they said something about the inline-block causing images to give themselves weird margins. I haven’t tried it out myself, but maybe it works. 

Hi everybody! Thank you for your help. As a true beginner (i started to code 2 weeks ago) i just
tryed another method and now i made 2 div inline block with a width of 50% and float to the left and the other one with a float to the right and the little white stripe between the two columns dispeared… Now my problem is to animate this. And it is really hard!!
Thanks again!!

Nice work! High fives all around! Happy coding! 

If you have display: inline-block, the gap is caused by the spaces within html. So you could do:
<img><!--
--><img>

to overcome this issue.

124,Understanding Positioning,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,3,"
I’m been doing the Build a Website Design System project, however, I’ve got confused what the scenario would be when to use Display Inline-Block, Float or Position Absolute/Relative.
On this project I used all 3 methods to try and fully understand all of them. The colors section,  I’ve got 6 different colors (2 rows of 3), so I used Float Left. The Fonts section I used Display Inline-Block (2 columns of 3). And for the Text Styles section, I used Position Absolute (2 rows of 2 boxes). If I’m correct, I think I could of used Display Inline-Block for all of them.
As far as I can see, would you only consider using a Float for images with text wrapped around it?
Also, when would Position Absolute/Relative is useful?
","
I have not played with the float very much so can’t say for sure on that.
Position absolute will make other elements ignore that items presence, it can be useful for overlapping elements, such as putting a block of text on top of a picture.
And position relative can be used for moving an object relative to its given position.
One of my favorite ways to use this is making buttons that look like they are being clicked when you click them :
HTML:
<div class=""button"">
    <a href=""put you source path here"">Name of Button<a>
</div>

CSS
button {
    color: blue
}

button a {
    border: 5px outset darkblue;
    position: relative;
}

button a:active {
    border: 5px inset darkblue;
    top: 2px;
}

As far as I can see, would you only consider using a Float for images with text wrapped around it?

Float is useful with images but also useful when making a dropcap first letter in a paragraph like so.
Great answer here about floats.
Relative and absolute, I will use when I need to put an element exactly where I need it.  In other words, I need more precision than a justify-content, align-items or text-align property will give me.
Or I’ll use it when I need random spacing on the webpage to be populated.  Like, I’m trying to mimic randomness positioning (i.e. in nature).  Here’s a food example placing toppings on a pizza (you never know when you’ll be working for Domino’s )
The secret sauce about absolute is if you make its parent container position relative then it is absolute to its parent container.  In other words, using the top/bottom/left/right properties are confined to the parent container.   So top 0% and left 0% is the upper left corner of the parent container.  So you can get very exact positioning within any parent container.

126,How to set z-index?,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",8,"
Hello,
I want to create a hover effect for my button as displayed in the below link:
https://lxk70.csb.app/
The idea is to have a transition effect while hovering over the button so as to get a white overlay over it. Here’s my code:
https://ej2lj.csb.app/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <title>buttons</title>

  <style>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.btn-container {
  background: orange;
  width: 100%;
  height: 500px;
}

.btn {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 20px;
}

.btn button {
  background: transparent;
  padding: 20px;
  border: none;
  color: #fff;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.2em;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.btn1 {
  border: 1px solid #fff;
  position: relative;
  transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.btn1 button:hover {
  color: orange;
}

.btn1 button:after {
  content: '';
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
  position: absolute;
  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out;
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  background-color: #fff;
  z-index: -1;
}

.btn1 button:hover:after {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class=""btn-container"">
    <div class=""btn btn1"">
      <button>Hover Me</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>

The only problem is when z-index is set to ‘-1’ the transition effect disappears. I’m confused as to what’s wrong here.
","
It looks like it’s working. On hover a white background transitions from left to right and the text become green.  If I remove z-index: -1 then the background covers the text.
Is this not the effect your looking for?

Perhaps you are only looking at the first link (green button) and that works absolutely fine. But that is only for reference. What I really need is the second button to work the same. I hope you won’t mind having a look over the second link.

Oops.  Sorry about that.  Yes, when I load in the CSS for the 2nd example I can only get it to work when I add a z-index of 1 to .btn1 and .btn1 button:before has the z-index of -1 setting it farthest back.
Using either pseudo clas of :before or :after works the same.


Glad you looked.
The Z-index in the first button needs to be set in one obvious place whereas in the second one it needs to be specified for its parent element as well. Could you explain what’s really going on and why does the second button behave differently?
Thanks for the help.

I’m not entirely sure.
The interesting thing is if I move your orange BG color to the body.  Remove orange BG color from your .btn-container DIV, then I can remove the extra z-index: 1 from .btn1.  It works like the 1st example works.
The differences I see is that they put the background color on body.  You put the BG color on your button container.  Also you have one extra DIV wrapping another DIV which wraps the button.  They just have one DIV which wraps around their button.
Somehow your extra DIV is requiring an extra z-index.
Sorry wish I could explain why it works but I’m not sure.
here it is with both buttons.  Slightly differnt HTML but only one z-index on the pseudo-class :after


Okay, I know why example 1 only used one z-index.  It’s because an element with z-index: -1 can never go behind the body tag.  here’s a test: https://codepen.io/SixStringsCoder/pen/jObwwoe
Your example, used 2 DIVs and the BG color was set on your outer DIV.  The z-index: -1 was placed on the pseudo-element, so when I placed a z-index of 1 on the inner DIV, that placed it above the other DIV.
In other words, 2 DIV can be flexible and go in front of or behind each other based on the z-index.
You can’t do that with the body.  The Body DIV will always be the lowest element.  Z-index: -1 can’t even hide behind it.

Now I see. I was actually getting desperate and didn’t see what was really happening there with my two DIVs. But now it’s all clear. The pseudo element was getting placed behind the .btn-container and thus it wasn’t showing up.
Thanks a lot. It was quite helpful.

There’s also this Tank game to practice with Flex Box: http://www.flexboxdefense.com/

128,React & Css: How to style multiple nested components?,"Get Help,CSS","learn-grid,general",12,"
Hi!
After taking a few courses here (Front-end with React, HTML and CSS), I’ve decided to go on and try to develop my own project, coded with React and styled with CSS. I was doing well so far in the React part, but when I tried to style everything a little to give it a form, I hit a wall.
I’m using grid display with CSS files to try and order everything on my page, but it seems that child components can only express themselves within their parent component. which makes it extremely difficult to organize when there’s something like 5 or 6 degrees between the original parent component and the final child component, and that you want to display each of these components on the same page, but in different locations (and not necessarily locations that are included in the perimeter of the previous parent component).
Is there a best practice to follow here in order to achieve that?
What’s commonly used as CSS styling method when there are several components that need to appear on the same page but they’re all nested in one another?
I would really appreciate help on this as I’ve been struggling for a few days on this 
Thanks!!

Hi @ruby0855699667, I have moved your topic into the CSS category, as I think you will get better answers that way. Let me know if you want it changed back.

Thank you.
I’m still not sure wether it belongs to React or CSS function, as fundamentally it is a CSS issue, but I suspect only React devs would be able to tackle it, that’s why I originally posted it in the React section.

If your layout is very complex with precise positioning needed (example), CSS Grid will help a lot.
Otherwise, use CSS Flex Box for most of your needs.  It will handle symmetrical layouts very easily or layouts where you need to auto-wrap elements (i.e. a bunch of book rows or a bunch of product rows will auto-wrap to the next line).  It’s great for responsive design, too, (small screen , tablets , big computer screens).

Thank you very much for your reply!
Actually what I’m trying to do is kinda similar to the complex design you’ve linked in your message. Except that in my version, imagine a search bar on the left that would return a list of elements right under the search bar, and displayed in a scrollable column, and each time u click on one, it displays the details in the same way details of elements are displayed in your example.
And to achieve that, basically I have a SearchResult parent Component rendering a List Component rendering several Elements components, each rendering an ElementDetail component (for which I turn display on/off on click).
In your version it seems you’re not using component at all. Does it mean I have to give up components and nesting to use the grid styling? In this case, is it better to give up coding using components, or would it be better to use an alternate CSS display method? (And if so, which one?).
Thank you!

No, components is not an issue.  Components in the end just compile down to regular HTML elements which can be affected by CSS.  Using Grid, Flex Box or any CSS with React is just fine.
Can you post a picture or a drawing of the layout?  That will be a better way to say what would be best.
Understand that some parts of this layout may be best with Flex Box and other smaller parts can use CSS Grid.  You can mix them to make your final layout.

Sure.

So basically, on step:
1/It renders the page, but only the search component (the search bar) and the recipient for the search result (scrollable list, empty for now).
2/Enter a search term and click on search. Renders a Result List component in the search result recipient.
3/You can scroll through the Result List component and click on one element.
4/Upon click on one element, it renders a Details component which displays its details on the right
Basically and simply put, that’s how it works.
My problem is, since 4 is nested in 3, which is nested in 2 which is nested in 1, 4 can only be displayed in the zone allocated to 1 originally, and so on. (If I use what I know of grid display in CSS).
Is there a way to go around that, use grid system, have the display I want, but not be prisoner of a parent or grand-parent grid?

When I see this layout, I would tend to use Flex Box for most of it balancing it with margin and/or padding properties to refine positioning.   Of course, Grid could work, too, but there’s enough symmetry that Flex Box could work using parent and child properties.
Are you challenging yourself to do this in Grid and therefore, trying to only use Grid?  Or are you allowing yourself to use whatever works, including a combination of ways?
Here’s a sketch of the outer most elements using Flex: https://codepen.io/SixStringsCoder/pen/db5589ae9283e3782328912e8fb9d03e
Here’s Grid only: https://codepen.io/SixStringsCoder/pen/347a71165b7685b033043644c28b36ae
Depends on what you’re challenging yourself to practice with this project.  I think Flex could do it and in some cases with Section 3 you wouldn’t need Flex nor Grid if you use block level HTML elements which will sit on top of each other.

Thanks again for taking the time.
I wasn’t challenging myself to do everything with Grid, but when I started to code the CSS, that’s what seemed the most natural to me. Plus, we’re not being taught Flex in the codecademy CSS course, so I didn’t know anything…Now I’ve learned the basics of it, and tried to apply them to my styling. It feels like it fits better for my project indeed, but eventually I run into the same problem. I’m starting to think the issue is how I coded the React part that makes it impossible for me to obtain the styling I’m after. Here are the 2 elements that fundamentally cause me trouble:
import React from 'react';
import Dealer from '../Dealer/Dealer';
import './Dealerslist.css';

class Dealerslist extends React.Component{

    render(){
        if(this.props.dealerResults.length === 0){
            return (
                <div className=""List"">
                <h2>Dealers list</h2>
                <h2>No Results</h2>
                </div>
            )
        }else if(this.props.isClear){
        return(
<div className=""ContainerDealerslist"">
    {this.clearState}
    <div className=""List"">
    <h3>Dealers list</h3>
</div>
    {this.props.dealerResults.map(dealr=>
        {return(
        <Dealer onClick={this.handleClick} dealr={dealr} key={dealr.id}/>);}
        )
        } 
</div>
        );
    }
    }
}


export default Dealerslist;

Here’s the related CSS:
.List{
width:20%;
height: 5%;
display:flex;
border:6px yellow solid;
flex-direction:column;
}

.ContainerDealerslist{
width:100%;
height:100%;
border:5px blue solid;
}

so basically in the component above, I render a list of Dealer’s components. Now here’s the Dealer component itself:
import React from 'react';
import DealerDetails from '../DealerDetails/DealerDetails';
import './Dealer.css';

class Dealer extends React.Component{
constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state={
        showComponent: false,
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    this.clearState = this.clearState.bind(this);
}
handleClick(){
    this.setState({
      showComponent: true,
    });
  }

  clearState(){
      this.setState({
          showComponent: false
      })
  }

    render(){
            return(
                <div>
                <div className=""RealDealer"">
                <button onClick={this.handleClick}>details</button>
                <img src={this.props.dealr.logo} height=""80"" width=""80"" alt=""logo shop""/>
                  <h5>{this.props.dealr.name}, {this.props.dealr.location}</h5>
                </div>
              {this.props.clearState}
              <div className=""RealDealerDetails"">
                <DealerDetails dealer={this.props.dealr} state={this.state.showComponent}/>
              </div>
              </div>

            );
    }
     
};

export default Dealer;

and here’s the related CSS (Some of the styling is just here for the visibility of my tests):
.RealDealer{
width:20%;
display:flex;
border:3px purple solid;
}

.RealDealerDetails{
position:absolute;
display:flex;
z-index: 10;
border:5px greenyellow solid;

}

so my Dealer component renders each Dealer’s basic info, plus a DealerDetails component (Only shows up with onClick event handler). So the pattern of rendering each time is:
Dealer A basic info
Dealer A DealerDetails component
Dealer B basic info
Dealer B DealerDetails component
My problem is, even though I’m fine with the Dealer’s basic info being displayed in a list (that’s the expected result, and that’s what correspond the 3/ in the drawing of my previous post), I’m not fine with the details being rendered where they are rendered. I would like them to render everytime in the “Details” of my previous message’s drawing, but no matter how I experiment with Flex and/or Grid, I can’t manage to get it there. Is there something I’m missing? 

Ruby, why don’t meet on CodePen to discuss this.  I familiarized myself with the code you provided but I’m unsure of a few things and it would be good to see all the code.  I’m more than happy to help and it will probably be a lot less going back and forth.
One thing I want to check out is if you have a bigger container around your DealersList and Dealer components.  It currently looks like the DealerList component, with width of 100%, is taking up all the space.  Then RealDealer has 20% width which means it could be off of the screen?
Plus, RealDealerDetails may be better off with flex-direction: column rather than the default “row” you currently have it set at.
Anyway, message me.  I’m in Portland, OR (PST) and I’m more than willing to meet about this and help however a I can.  Let me know where you’re at so we can set up a time.

Thank you Steve! The CodePen session was eye-opening even if it didn’t work properly XD
So to end this topic, I finally managed to solve my issue, not by changing my CSS code, but by fundamentally changing the way I coded my React components. Having the Dealer’s Details being rendered as a child of a single Dealer element somehow restricted this child element to the parent one, and no matter what display system I used, I couldn’t manage to get the Dealer’s details to display where I wanted to.
So instead of that, upon search I generated both a dealer’s list and the Dealer’s details. By doing so, I was able to separate the two display zones, and that did the trick! 
Hope it’ll help someone along the way.
Again, thank you Steve!

One thing my wife, Rebecca, and I do before we start React projects is we:


Draw the website layout on paper or in Photoshop/Illustrator


Make a static website only using HTML and CSS.  This helps solve a lot of the layout issues with Flex/Grid


Then we copy our HTML and CSS into React components.  Then make small adjustments to HTML if needed.


Add the logic to the components.


We found it easier than working straight away with React.
That said, sometimes it’s just fun to start code in React right away.  But I usually get lost later on when the components start to pile up!

Hello,
This line is causing the problem.

Thank you for looking into this.
I’ve reviwed the line but not sure why it is causing this error. The display problem I mentioned is related instructions table which doesn’t include the title row. Maybe I’m still missing the point?

You have a semi-colon that’s outside of the declaration block. It’s obstructing the following ruleset (which, in this case, is represented by .instructions-row).

.instructions-title {
  display: inline; 
  font-size: 18px; 
  color: #00ffff; 
  font-family: 'Work Sans'
}; <-------- // is obstructing the next line

.instructions-row {margin:0 auto; width: 400px; }

Hi everybody, can someone please explain why we should use CSS Flexbox, as compared to using regular CSS? What does it have that regular CSS doesn’t? Thank you!
","
Hello @ezl_programming, my understanding is that flexbox allows elements to be vertically and horizontally aligned easily, as well as providing more pleasing aesthetics than regular CSS.


Flexbox vs Grid display
Flexbox is similar to a grid layout, in that it enables elements to be positioned correctly within their container. However flexbox and grid layouts do have fundamental differences.  One difference is that flexbox is one dimensional, whereas grid is two. Grid also has spacing capacity, whereas flexbox does not. This website gives the different uses nicely. I’m not sure whether you’re up to grid display yet.


Thank you @tera5288723178!

Learn FlexBox!  It’s a god-send!  It’s so easy to layout a page or layout a section of a page with it.
Check out FlexBox Froggy to see a little how it works: https://flexboxfroggy.com/

How does step 5 make changes to the website if there are no offset properties used with the relative value?
In step 10 I tried to use fixed to keep the header at the bottom of the webpage. The text was aligned to the left after doing this. I got it back to center by using an offset value. Is there a way to center the element or text without having to eyeball the pixels to offset? I tried text-align and margin: auto. Neither of which worked.

Hi there, welcome to the forums!
The issue is your <ul> element.
If we use the dev tools, we can see that the <ul> element is taking up the full width of the screen:

image961×94 2.83 KB

If you change the display property of your <ul> element, it should work how you wanted. 

Hello and welcome to the community,
You’re over-complicating things a bit, but for the sake of experimentation:
.navigation ul {
  display: inline;
}

The unordered list should also be displayed inline.
If you decide to use inline for all elements, then add this and it will work.
But you can definitely find a better way

Haha, that’s happened to me before. 
I think your explanation is better than mine anyway. 

Thanks guys! You solved my problem!

Now that I’m done with “display: inline” I decided to place everything where I wanted initially. With my high level of confidence and some good time on the web and this forum I still could not place h1 “Constantin-Music” to the center of the screen without affecting the nav bar on the right. Margin: 0 auto is not doing anything. Please see my code below:

    <h1>CONSTANTIN-MUSIC</h1>

If we make the text transparent on a white background, it will seem like it’s white (although it simply doesn’t show).
Wouldn’t it be better to have the text be black, or a color similar to that of your background image?
I’m not entirely sure what the desired effect is supposed to be?

If you want the text to be transparent in order to show the background image, i’m not sure it can be done. I think the easiest way would be to have the text be of a similar color to the background?

It’s difficult to do and not all browsers support it.
here’s a tutorial on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFf7wnA5MqQ

That’s actually pretty cool, thanks for sharing Steve!

Unfortunately, the video is from 2017.  I have trouble getting mix-blend-mode to work consistently.  But that aside, it is a cool CSS property in its own right.
Also check out CSS filter for some more coolness: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter

135,Clear all pre-formatting sheet?,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"
I’m currently working on a personal project which is a personal portfolio website and is the first real project I have done and I seem to remember something about an additional sheet I should be adding to my project. A separate sheet to style.css that basically clears all pre-formatting for CSS and that it is best practice to always use this when making websites.
Could somebody confirm if this really is best practice, and where I might be able to find this piece of documentation?
Thanks

Hi Jared,
I think that you’re looking for this: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
If I’m not mistaken, this is directly included in the Bootstrap framework so, yes, I believe it can be considered best practice. Browsers compatible: Chrome, Edge, Firefox ESR+, IE 10+, Safari 8+, Opera.

I concur that the font does not seem to be loading from the local folder., though it is present. I just used the external source for that font so the layout was complete. Not sure what the issue with the local font is.
There is a stray closing brace in your stylesheet right after the fonts, but I doubt that has anything to do with the issue at hand.

yes seems like there’s a bug happening? I fixed that closing brace but still not working…
I can only load this font from google, and it works fine.
Thanks Roy, anyway, I’ll leave it for now.

I am having the same issue - did it the same exact way as you.
I just want to make sure I did it correctly and its a glitch, not a failure on my part.

Spent half an hour staring at the same line of code only to realise everyone else experienced the same problem  Hope this gets fixed soon!

I had this problem too. Then I watched the video at the end and realised that the error was the ‘src’ address.
Instead of:-
src: url(…/fonts/CroissantOne-Regular.ttf)
it should be:-
src: url(fonts/CroissantOne-Regular.ttf)
so no “…/” in front of the ‘fonts’ folder. I looked at the file organisation of this lesson and the css file is on the same level as the ‘fonts’ folder, so the css just has to enter ‘fonts’ and not go out of itself, then down into the ‘fonts’ folder.
I appreciate you folks might’ve discovered this by now, but I’m putting this here for the benefit of anyone whose just joined and is puzzling out this project.
: )

I cannot find the URL for the fonts at all!

Hello! I have a very similar problem in step 7. I simply copy-paste the api in the css sheet for the font face
exactly as this
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Merriweather';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Merriweather Regular'), local('Merriweather-Regular'), url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/merriweather/v21/u-440qyriQwlOrhSvowK_l5-fCZM.woff2) format('woff2');

but the src part appear all as red text, while all thr url part is recognized as non code after “https:” due to “//” i guess

137,How do I format text in HTML to make it look like code?,"Get Help,CSS",general,6,"
Hi there,
I’ve been working on the HTML and CSS cheatsheet, which is open-ended as some of you may know. As you can see from the screenshot, I’m working on building a reference for CSS selectors and specificity. In it, I’ve included a table with column headings of the specificity, syntax, and description of each selector.  What I’m stuck on is how I can use the skills I’ve acquired to format the syntax of the CSS example text in HTML. For example, to format the syntax of the id selector, I would want it to look something like this:
#ID {
  color: red;
}

I basically want to be able to format the text to include highlighting and features which are built in an IDE or text editor when writing code. I’ve included a screenshot of how CSS code is formatted in VSCode, which is the type of formatting I would like to apply to my HTML text.
image|690x67

Any suggestions?

Hello and welcome to the forums @obscenecor
I have been working on cheetsheets too and found that you can use the span element too chooses a specific group of words.
Just rap the words in <span> example </span>
Then style them with CSS by reffering to the span elements id.

span {
color: red;
}

I hope that answers your question. 
you can find more instructions at this link…
developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals

Thank you for the warm welcome! Also, I want to Thank you for making me understand how I can apply styling to an individual text.  Also, is there any way I could mimic the indentation that a text editor applies to my code, just to make it more readable?  For example, you can see that the screenshot above has the CSS declarations (property-value pairs) indented a certain way to make the text more appealing. I can’t seem to do this in HTML.  Suggestions?

You can use the CSS text-indent property…
p {
text-indent: 20px;
}
I have my example measured in pixels though you can use other measurments.

Thank you so much! I didn’t even know that existed! All the best!

@obscenecor, I’m not sure exactly how you are planning to use this, but if you want to distinguish lines of code or code blocks from normal text on your page, you can achieve this using the <code> and <pre> tags and then style those in CSS with the colors you want.
So if you want to just show one line of code or less, wrap it in <code> tags (<code>your code here</code>) and it looks like this:
new_lst = [x for x in lst].
If you want to put in a block of code that contains your indentations, etc, you wrap that like this:
<pre><code>your code here</code></pre>

and it will look something like this:
new_lst = []
for x in lst:
    new_lst.append(x)

Then you can move over to your CSS file and change the colors.  For example, on my website and blog I used this:
code{
    color: whitesmoke;
    background-color: black;  
}

pre{
    color: whitesmoke;
    background-color: black;
    scrollbar-color: dark;
    width: 100%;
    max-height: 800px;
    display: inline-block;
    overflow: auto;  
}

This won’t style the color for the individual words in your code block (you can do that with <span> tags and classes, etc.), but it should give you a good starting place.
Happy coding!

139,Avoid using IDS,"Get Help,CSS","selectors-visual,general",7,"
after learning the difference between class and id selectors i was thinking of avoid using IDS because maybe i just found i need to style another element with the same id  so i will have to change this id to a class to be able to use it in different elements .
so avoid using IDS to be safe is this a good practice or am i missing something ?
","
Hi there.
There should never be more than one element in an HTML document with any given id attribute. The id is meant to be a unique identifier for a specific, single element of the page.


This is supported by the HTML5 specification from the WHATWG.

image1344×316 23.7 KB

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute

If you have several elements which need to share common styling, then yes you should use a class or element selector. 

thank you for your replying but i think you didn’t understand me maybe because of my English…
i know the id is unique but i was asking isn’t that will be better if i just avoid using it in my HTML that’s because maybe in big projects say i made an id id = 'test' for element1 and then i found that i need to use the same style in element2 so to fix this i will need to change the id and make it a class class ='test' .
so why shouldn’t i avoid using IDS and only use classes even if i will need this class for one element because maybe i will change my mind later during the project.

There is no need to avoid using id, just so long as we understand the need for uniqueness. The attribute is quite special in a number of ways.

global identifier
fragment identifier
high specificity selector

The key is to have a purpose in mind. We don’t just pull things out of thin air but write everything with purpose. If the purpose is in the above list, then it fits with intended usage.
Aside
Avoid using white space in attributes. It makes for better readability.
class=""test""

vs
class = ""test""

The only white space should be in the separation of attributes.
<p class=""test"" title=""Opening paragraph"">

</p>

thank you for this great advice!



 mtf:

The only white space should be in the separation of attributes.



so
using a class for only one element
vs
using an id
isn’t both will have the same properties ?



 mtf:


global identifier
fragment identifier
high specificity selector







 enghosamokasha:

using a class for only one element


First rule of CSS is to use the lowest possible specificity. We only increase importance when there is a good reason. A class only indicates a selector rule. There is no harm in using it on one element for the purpose of styling, and no need for id just because there is only one element.
If we want in page navigation, then we write ids to identify the fragments. That way we can write links to move around the page.
<a href=""#article1"">Jump to Article One</a>

The fragment can even be reached from another page.
 <a href=""/articles/index.html#article1"">See Article One</a>

We’re using ID for one of its intended purposes. We can style with ID, though given the rule of thumb of low specificity, we are probably better off using CLASS.

really thank you for making this clear .

141,Tea Cozy Project Issue,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,4,"
Hi Everyone,
I am new to coding but thought I had been picking it up ok so far - now I have come across a stumbling block!!
I am on the practice exercise to create the TeaCozy website on my own computer.
I have managed to get the background image the top and our the h2 and h4 headers there BUT :

I have centre the text with a black background horizontally within the image but I can’t get it to centre vertically?
The black back ground is significantly wider than it should be and I can’t figure out how to get it narrower.

Any help appreciated.
Thanks!

Here is the HTML I am using :
        <body>

    <div class=""mission"">
        <h4>Handpicked, Artisanally Curated, Free Range, Sustainable, Small Batch, Fair Trade, Organic Tea</h4>

142,A CSS Grid item seems to be taking up more than one row,"Get Help,CSS","display-positioning,general",9,"
Good morning,
I’m working on a class project and have a prototype page up at:
www.markholleyproject.com/index.php
The top navigation bar-div seems to be taking up more than on row, even though the CSS declaration is:
.navigationbartop {
    grid-area: 1 / 2 / 1 / 6;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: black;
    }

As far as I know, it should start in row 1 and end in row 1. I’m not sure if other styles that I have are conflicting with or superseding this; I don’t think so, but I could be wrong.
The full HTML and CSS markup follows.

Hello @markholley. This may not be the reason, but have a look at this:



 markholley:

grid-area: 1 / 2 / 1 / 6;


Should the row start at 1 and end at 1? Aren’t rows exclusive, meaning that they end before the number you specify?
I hope this helps!

All I know is that this:
grid-area: 1 / 2 / 1 / 6;
looks the same as this:
grid-area: 1 / 2 / 2 / 6;
And, if I do this:
grid-area: 1 / 2 / 6 / 6;
the row becomes huge indeed (spanning 6 rows), so I know that the declaration is working. It’s just that “start row 1 end row 1” looks the same as “start row 1 end row 2”.
After reading your reply, I tried:
grid-area: 1 / 2 / 0 / 6;
and 0 / 2 / 1 / 6;
just to see what would happen. Neither gave me anything desirable.

Hello. I’m sorry. I couldn’t help more; I’ve only just finished the ‘grid’ CSS myself. Maybe try just doing grid-row-start: and grid-row-end? It might help?

I’ll give it a shot, thank you tera!
Just to place this here - this is my call to that particular CSS rule:

                </ul>
            </nav>
        </div>
</body>

</html>


Welcome-I hope it works!

Another thought; maybe try making the <ul> the grid-container, that way there are only individual things in the grid (<li>)? For example have:
<div>
<nav>
<ul class=""navigationbartop"">
<li><!--code--></li>
<!--ect.-->
</ul>
</nav>
</div>

Also, although it probably won’t help, maybe try removing the <div> tags? Since <div> and <nav> do similar jobs, maybe it is confusing the CSS? These are just ideas?

Same problem, even after separating my code out to:
.navigationbartop {
    grid-row-start: 1;
    grid-row-end: 1;
    grid-column-start: 2;
    grid-column-end: 6;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: black;
    }


The problem might be that the CSS is calling the grid on a <div> which contains a <ul>, which might mean that the code thinks the list in the div is ‘one element’, if you get what I mean, and so even though it is taking up only one row of the grid, the list is taking up a lot of space, increasing the size of the row? You could also try to set the grid row size and see what happens?

Hey what error is it giving you?

As @janneslohmeijer said (or actually wrote ), could you copy the error?
So is it a codecademy error?
Without the error all I can think of is that there is already a selector for .pull-quote and codecademy wwanted you to set its width inside that selector.

Hmm, that’s weird, this shouldn’t give an error. Could you try and reset the exercise using that “recycle” button at the bottom and try again?

So is there a selector for it already?

Just asking: did you by any chance use the Greek question mark instead of a semi-colon?

The problem was when I pasted the link from Google Fonts, it came up as incorrect. Even though Google seemed to have changed the layout since the video on the previous task, I was able to select Space Mono and the font weights 400 and 700. Thus, I don’t understand why it’s not accepting it.
In the end I accepted the solution. On closer inspection, the difference between the solution and Google Fonts links were slightly different (both had the Space Mono and font weights in the links)
Why is this happening?

Hey @jgokop!
I think this may be the topic you’re looking for. Apparently, a new version of google font has added something onto the URL which makes the lesson fail.




FAQ: CSS Typography - Linking Fonts II CSS FAQ


This article might explain this in better detail. 
Basically, the deal is that Google decided to add a default &display=swap to all the google fonts. Unfortunately, this exercise was created before this change was made, which is why you got an error when you just copied over the link, @mnkori 
I would recommend reporting it as a bug for anyone else dealing with this, and just deleting that last part of the link while you’re waiting for it to be fixed.

In exercise it is written that it is best practice create separate classes for single element,instead of putting all styles in one class? I have seen on many webpage through inspect element,for a single element they have multiple class e.g font,position etc.My Question is how would I know how many classes would I need for specific element and on what basis developer do separation of classes?Sorry if the question seems to be confusing.Or simply how to make reusable classes

You could create small utility components that you can re-use everywhere in your project.
Say you want to use the font Roboto for all your headings throughout your project. Rather than specifying font-family: ""Roboto""; every time, for every single heading, you could just create an utility class that will take care of this and this only.
.roboto {
  font-family: ""Roboto"";
}

and use it throughout your HTML.
<body>
  <main>
    <article>
      <h1 class=""roboto"">The main heading</h1>
      <p>Some text</p>
      <h2 class=""roboto"">Some other heading</h2>
      <p>Some text</p>
    </article>
  </main>
</body>

Or let’s imagine that you want to use lists. Some lists might require a list-type: none, whereas others might not.
You could simply create a small utility class to apply it when necessary:
.nobullets {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

It seems to me that large chunks of code for every single selector seems more “intuitive” at first. Structuring your code in a smart way, composed of small re-usable components might be more demanding at first, but then make your life much easier when the project grows big and you need to maintain it. So, small components, and comments whenever something isn’t self-explanatory would be, in my book, what should be considered good practice.

Thankyou it was quite helpful.Things gonna be much clear with experience I Believe

153,Paint Store lesson - HTML/CSS class selector inconsistency,"Get Help,CSS","learn-colors,general",6,"
Hi all!
I’m following the course on how to build a website and currently doing the CSS lesson on colors and have a question that’s been frustrating me in the “Paint Store” exercise:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/intermediate-css-colors-and-typography/modules/learn-css-colors/projects/color-paint-store
In step 6, the span selectors are being chosen using the .reds .base-color selector in CSS. However, in HTML, there is no “reds” class. The same holds true for the other colors (blues and greens). In HTML, these divs have a class of class=“color reds”, but in CSS, they are simply referred to as .reds.
Why does the CSS code work, and why is it coded using a class that is not defined in HTML?
Hope you guys can help me out with this nagging doubt!
Best,
Nuno
","
in css, to select an element we do:
div {
}

in css to select a class we do:
.className {
}

to select an id we do:
#idName {
}

by using the prefixes (. for class and # for id), css knows what the selector is for
so where in html we have a class keyword, in css this is represented with a full stop (.)

I understand that. My point was that there is no class named “reds” in HTML, although CSS refers to one.

html and css are very error resistant, if there is a class in css while not used in html, the class simply never gets applied

Their is a class of reds and it’s color reds. Whitespace in a class name gives it multiple classes.

Hello there!
I’m currently working on the “Tea Cozy” self directed project module for part 4 of the web development path and I noticed something odd.
I was trying my best to both type out my own code and using the pre-made html and css within the project and I found it weird that in the beginning, nothing was displaying correctly or as expected.
When I copy pasted the pre-existing code within the assignment, it all showed up just fine. I copied the code onto a separate file and renamed it ‘INDEXTWO.html’ in comparison to my original ‘index.html’. Same code, different filename, and for some reason the html that was under ‘index’ did not display correctly. When I renamed that file into ‘indexy’ (or any other name really) only THEN it actually displayed correctly.
I just thought it was something interesting to talk about, and is there a reason why this happened in the first place? I never had this issue with past projects.
Thanks for reading!

155,Absolute position gets hidden conditionally,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,3,"
Hello I am a newbie here in web development. I am having some question with CSS position property. Initially, following is my HTML  and CSS code.
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">
  <head>
    <meta charset=""utf-8"">
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""test.css"" type=""text/css"">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class=""one"">
      
    </div>

    <div class=""two"">

    </div>

    <div class=""three"">
      
    </div>

 </body>
</html>

CSS
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.one {
  background-color: indigo;
  color: white;
  height: 100px;
  position: absolute;
}

.two { 
  height: 1000px;
  background-color: chartreuse;
}

.three {
  height: 300px ;
  background-color: crimson;
  position: absolute;
}

I have set absolute position for classes one and three. And these div’s no longer are part of the normal document flow. So div with class two takes all the space.  I am providing a JSFiddle link for the output.
As, we can see, the class two div takes all the space. We do not see class one and three at all as they are no longer part of the normal document flow. Now, I put some text inside class one and three.
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">
  <head>
    <meta charset=""utf-8"">
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""test.css"" type=""text/css"">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class=""one"">
      <h1>This is start</h1>
    </div>

    <div class=""two"">

    </div>

    <div class=""three"">
      <h1>This is end</h1>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>


I have not changed the CSS. Now, here is the link to new JSFiddle output. As we can see, classes one and three are now visible. But, class one has been partially overlapped by class two as all other space is taken by class two. But class three is just apart from class two. So, I have two questions here. When we included the text in classes one and three, why did they appear even if the position is absolute ? And why class two is behaving differently with class one and class three when the text is introduced ?
Thanks
","
Can anybody help me here ?

Out of normal flow does not mean out of view, it just means the top left corner of the parent (or body) will be the draw location. Since both absolutely positioned divs have the same reference point, one is drawn above the other. The last one to be drawn is the one we see.

Sounds to me like you’re describing a common aspect of responsive design - where your site layout adapts to the available screen real estate to optimise the viewing for the visitor.
Given that the project doesn’t seem to give you any boilerplate code to start with (from what I can see), it strikes me as odd that you’d get that behaviour accidentally?
Can you post the HTML and CSS you’re working with? (The learning environment is user-specific, so we can’t see your work by clicking the link.)

paragraphs are block elements, so you have:
block element
inline element
block element
the block elements cause the inline element to be on its own line. If you would add another inline element (like an image), the span and image would be inline.

Thanks for your explanation, could you tell me please how I can make a block element e.g <p> and the <span> be in the same line?

Depends on why and how. You could nest the span within the paragraph. You could use CSS to change display or positional settings.

I put it inside the <p> but looks ugly, I want to have the <span> box just at the adjacent space to the left side of the paragraph without being overlap by the two black boxes.

162,Background-Image Not Loading,"Get Help,CSS",selectors-visual,7,"
Hi,
I’ve come a bit unstuck with the Dasmoto’s Arts and Crafts project in the Intro to Local Web Development module. I’ve got everything working with it, except I can’t get the background image for the main title banner to show. I’ve checked, double and triple checked my path definitions in the background-image url attribute but I can’t find any errors. Indeed, I’m using VSCodes auto fill options to navigate to the file, so it should be recognising it (doing this as a seperate img element in the html index file results in the image being displayed fine). Can anyone identify something I’m missing here? My CSS code for this bit is:

.banner {
background-image: url(""./resources/images/pattern.jpeg"");
background-color: slategray;
font-size: 100px;
color: khaki;
text-align: center;
}

and in the HTML:
< 

<!--Title Banner Section-->
<div class = ""banner bold"">
    <h1>Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts</h1>
</div>


Thank you!
","
I managed to fix this by replacing the relative path with the internet url of the image. However, this still feels like it’s a problem. Should I not be able to use background-image with images that are stored locally?

I believe you should be able to. I don’t use the projects, I am broke, however, it seems like you can’t use files on your local storage. Also, what do you mean “local storage?” Is it on Codecademy or on your PC?

By local storage I mean on my PC. I am using VSCode on a Chromebook which means I have to use the linux storage which might be why its causing the issue. However, all the other images that I have stored in the same directory load (albeit with the  element rather then background-image which I haven’t checked) and are displayed correctly.

Yeah, there’s probably some special thing going on with the background-image. You may have to do some research to find an alternative.

What is your file structure in relation to the css file and the resources folder?

Hi,
I was really struggling with this as well. But after some extensive experimenting I managed to get it done with the relative path of the image:
HTML:
<h1 style=background-image:url(Resources/images/pattern.jpeg);background-repeat:no-repeat;height:130px;>Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts</h1>

However, I’m super new at coding so I don’t know if this code would even be acceptable.

164,CSS Explosion Prevention,"Get Help,CSS",general,4,"
For a project (shuftipro) I work on, I have relied heavily on CSS. At the moment, all CSS-styles are applied per class, so I’m now trying to move it to an external style to assist with future changes.
But I notice that I get a “CSS Explosion.” Now the problem is that I have difficulty deciding how best to organise and abstract data in the CSS file.
I use many div tags within the site and switch from a highly table-based site. So I get a lot of CSS selectors like this:
div.title {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

div.footer {
  /* Styles Here */
}

div.body {
  /* Styles Here */
}

/* And many more */

This is not too bad yet, but as I am a beginner, I wonder if it could be recommended how the different parts of a CSS file could be arranged best. For every item of my website, I don’t want a separate C SS tag, but I always want the CSS file very intuitive and simple to read.
My last goal is to make the CSS files easy to use and to demonstrate their ability to speed up the development of the site. In the future, other people who may work on this project are also able to use good coding standards, instead of the way I did.

Hey,
I feel your pain.
There are many ways to organize your CSS. Very subjective also since it is very much based on personal preferences.  Only hint I can give you is to section of parts in a way that is logical to you so you know where to adjust things if needed.
Mozilla has a document on organizing CSS, perhaps this can be of any assistance to you.

It wants to restrict it to just text inputs? Or all inputs?
If the latter, try changing your selector to input{} (removing the text type).

From a style guide perspective, we should not center align input fields but leave them with the default alignment (left). This is a usability and accessibility concern.
Agree with the above reply that suggests not using the attribute selector. Moot, now.

I attempted your suggestions, but to no avail unfortunately. I appreciate the help. Also, the center alignment was part of the assignment. In the assignment you are to essentially surgically remove the style settings from an HTML document, and compensate for their removal via CSS.

UPDATE: Still not sure exactly what happened, but I copied all of my code, closed the browser, then re-opened the exercise and pasted the code back. Low and behold, it worked. So I’m not sure what happened, but I thank you for your help.

“almost identical” is an overstatement.
Yes they are measurements that are relative.
But, where % relates to the size defined in the parent element. Meaning its size changes with each iteration.
vh relates to the height of the window
vw relates to the width of the window
These parameters are used to make your webpage responsive, i.e. readable in different sizes of viewing windows (mobile, desktop, tablet).

That depends entirely on what it is you want to achieve in your website aesthetic design. There no such thing as a better parameter.

This has happened in more than just CSS and even within the same exercise. For example, this practice has me change the font size of the paragraph labeled p to 18px. I then add “font-size: 18px;” within the curly-brackets and it says that it is wrong, afterwards I will ask for solution and nothing would have changed and the code added will be exactly the same as what I had. What is going on and am I doing something wrong?
Furthermore, while I play around with css and run the command that it asks nothing changes on the front-end website model, is that normal or is something going on?
Thank you
","
For your first question (code never changes, am i doing something wrong), the answer is no you are not doing anything wrong. The same thing happens to me.
For your second question (css tinkering, nothing changes), the question from me is what exactly are you changing? Is it the font (which is very noticable) or like margins or something?
My question: is this problem happening always (every time you change something) or just sometimes?

My problem is happening all of the time consistently and I can’t even do the assignments properly because nothing on the front end changes so I’m at a standstill in css and don’t know what to do. But for instance I changed a photo from very small to medium and then very high pixels and nothing happened, but when I chanced the height and width in the image on the front end html it changed. But it’s nice to know I’m not doing things wrong. And how do I go about it is what I’m wondering now.

Literally, just now I was taking the CSS course and it did the same thing. Perhaps our computers just aren’t used to whatever code Codecademy courses use to link stylesheets (I hope you understand, that was a mouthful).
To get around this, maybe you could do your best with the exercises, learn, click that show solutions button, and just feel confident in yourself until someone fixes it. Then when you build your own website you could use what you learned without any issues.

I too have had this issue before.  Maybe worth it to report a bug?

Yea, I brought it up to Codecademy support and they told me that their engineers were going to look at it and that I should keep them updated but it’s honestly all throughout the css practice so it’s hard to do so.

You will have to use an ID. That should work.

Hi there!
See this page on classes and IDs.  As @naomipinkflower says, you’ll need (and probably want) to use one of the two to reference an individual element.
Alternatively, you have the option to style an element inline, by using the element style property.  For example:
<p style=""color:white; text-align:center;"">Hello, World!</p>

This <p> element will have a color “white”, and will be center aligned.  If you’re only using this code once, and you’re okay with it being written this way, it might be best to do it this way.
You can take a look at this page relating to the different style formats.

172,Cursive Font Showing Up As Comic Sans MS,"Get Help,CSS",learn-typography,4,"
Project Link: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-setup-selectors/exercises/id-name?action=resume_content_item
Hello! I was following the project link above when it asked me to change a font to cursive. I did as it said, but instead of showing the cursive font, it showed the Comic Sans MS font which DEFINITELY wasn’t cursive.  I found a link to the old forums here:
https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/5578e45776b8fef62d0007f7
But I couldn’t follow the reply that well.
Hoping someone could help me with this.
Thanks!

Comic Sans MS font which DEFINITELY wasn’t cursive


On Windows machines, Comic Sans MS is the default cursive font.

Now that I know, but I don’t know how to change it.

Do you need to change it? If you use the generic family in your CSS,
font-family: cursive;

it will default to whatever your machine is set to. You can change your system settings, but be sure to research first so you know that you are replacing Comic Sans MS with another cursive font.
The simple approach that does not require any settings changes is to write a short list of cursive fonts,
font-family: font1, font2, font3, cursive;

where font1 is the font of choice, if available, font2 is the alternate, font3 is another alternate (in order of preference) and cursive is the fallback when none of the others are available on that system.

I modified a bit the CSS file and I think this is what you want.
.monthlyImages {
width: 60%;
margin: 0 auto;
text-align: center;
display: inline-flex;
position: relative;
top: 100px;

width: 300px;
height: 200px;
margin-right: 10px;

display: inline-flex;
text-align: center;
margin-top: 22%;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
position: relative;
right: 15%;
}
I modified the last part where the line was. I made it look a little bit nicer and changed the px to % to be more mobile-friendly. All the photos are alligned and their text is under them. Reply if this is ok, please. Good luck!

Yes this is exactly how I want the image text to be displayed however I want the images to go into two columns, so there’s three at the top and two at the bottom. When I try to change it using flex-wrap: wrap; it completely messes everything up.

174,Questions about Position of Elements,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,2,"
Hello! I have 2 questions about position.

For example, I have one element that is ubicated in the following position:

Left: 0px
Top 0px:
Position: absolute
And I want to put this element at the bottom of my web page. What I do is to try with different values like Top: +100 or Top +200, so the element goes down. But I have to try with different values until it is in the bottom. My question is if it is possible with Chrome Dev Tools to see the position of the entire web page (from left to right, and from top to bottom) to know exactly wich value I have to put so the element goes to the bottom in my first try.
For example, I want to know that value is needed to sent the element to the bottom, if I need Top:300px or Top:500 px. Where I can see these position values of the entire page?

The other question is this case.
I have 3 elements in my web page.

One is above the other. And I want to put the third element (that original position is in the bottom), in the top of the page.
I would have to move down manually the 2 other elements, because now this third element is going to be in the top.
There is any way I can make that this third element pull down the others automatically when it is place at the top? And the other 2 elements are going to be lower.
Thanks!!

Take a look at this example…

175,Flexbox - What does the display: flex; command influence,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,6,"
I’m having trouble understanding flexbox and what it targets.
i.e presume I have the following html code
<header>
    <ul class=""navBar"">
        <li><a href=""#"">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href=""#"">About</a></li>
    </ul>
</header>

In CSS to make home and about line up like a navigation bar (on the top, right side) would the correct thing to do be to set the header as a flex box or should I set the list items as inline-flex boxes, or set the unordered list as a flexbox etc. I’m finding it hard to understand what the display: flex; element targets like does it only target its direct children or everything under it…
","
display: flex is assigned to the parent. Its children will then be affected.
But why use flex for a horizontal navbar if you can style your li to be display: inline

Ohh… Yeah that’s way easier 
However, then when is the right time to use flexbox? When I can replace a lot of it’s benefits with properties such as margin, padding etc.

Well flex has many more possibilities when it comes to ordering the content, as it

can be laid out in any flow direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
can have display order reversed or rearranged at the style layer (i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
can be laid out linearly along a single (main) axis or wrapped into multiple lines along a secondary (cross) axis
can “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space
can be aligned with respect to their container or each other
can be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the container’s cross size.

Hello, @johnantonacci4655991.

I still can’t open my index.css file on VSC


Without knowing exactly what you mean by  “can’t”, this is a difficult issue for us to help you with. We can’t see your computer or file structure, so we can only go off of what you describe. Are you able to navigate to the DevProject folder specified in the walk-through from the VS Code ‘Open Folder’ prompt?
Another thought might be to go through a brief tutorial on how to use VS Code if you are unfamiliar with it. Here’s one: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics
You could also try searching for something like How to open a folder in VS Code in your favorite search engine.

Thanks for responding. The 1st screenshot will display the file structure that I created on my One Drive for the DevProject.
I did this first before I did anything on VSC, as CA instructed me.
The 2nd screenshot is from VSC. That will show the file structure of DevProject on VSC. Notice the index.css file. When I left click on that file, nothing happens. I’m only trying to open that file, as the lesson plan on Step 2.2 of that article instructs me to do.
The 3rd screenshot below will show you exactly where I’m at in the article link that I placed in the initial post. I’m still stuck on the section “Finally open the index.css file in your favorite text editor”

2020-01-06 (3)1024×768 68.6 KB

The 4th screenshot below displays what happens on VSC when I right click my cursor/mouse on the index.css file. Notice the drop down menu. None of the menu items permit me to open this file, left clicking should have opened the file, & done the trick, as the 3rd screenshot instructions instruct me to.

2020-01-03 (6)1024×768 59.8 KB

To make your life a little easier, here again is the link to the article that I’m stuck in for the sake of context. I’m stuck in section 2.2, that’s what I mean by not being able to open my index.css file.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/local-website-development/articles/f1-u2-create-first-prj

That’s not a file, is it.

As @ionatan just mentioned, your index.css is a folder not a file. Delete it, right click on the css folder, and select New File instead of New Folder, name it index.css and you should be all set.
Edited 1-6-2020 to correct typo.

Ok. That takes care of that up to that point. However, notice the screenshot of the next set of instructions were it says
“Be sure to save your changes for both files!”

2020-01-071024×768 65.9 KB

What changes do I have to save? I haven’t changed anything. From the beginning of this article, to this point, there is no mention of changes, that’s why I haven’t made any changes.
It’s confusing.
Here is the article again for the sake of context so that you can see from the beginning, till up to that point of “Be sure to save changes”, you can see that no changes were asked of me in the instructions.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/local-website-development/articles/f1-u2-create-first-prj

There are instructions to change your file. One of them is immediately above where they suggest you ensure that your files have been written to your file system.

Sorry, but I honestly don’t see where it says to change files. Are you referring to step 2 where I’m told to add my own title between title tags, & my own content between the body tags?
If not, can you send me a screenshot of where it says to make the changes?

If you have a file that starts out empty or even non-existent, and then later on it has data, then, it changed.

Can anyone tell me how to remove the blank space of a webpage please? Is it possible to limit the scrolling? I have no idea what to do.

Apparently you have an HTML element that is higher than the viewing window. Find out which element it is and adjust its height.
Subsequently you can assign your body the following attribute overflow: hidden
Happy coding!

How do i make an ul (lets say navigation header) to be in the middle of the page?
I did-
{
position: fixed;
width: 100%;
z-index: 2;
margin: 0 auto;
}
but its still stick to the left
I’m new here, and to programming and web developing in general
so thank you in advance and nice to meet you!
Eli
","
when using position: fixed, you also need left: auto and right: auto along with margin: 0 auto if i remember correctly
you can google this: css center fixed element

still didn’t solve it…
but thank you!

the width is 100%, so why should it center? I can only suggest things, if i actually need to fix it, you will need to provide your code (you could make a codepen, jsfiddle or jsbin (this are websites))

https://codepen.io/mediarcoiris/pen/mdywgyK
thats really cool!!!
so i want the “color” “fonts” “text style” at the top bar to by in the middle…
there is still lots where to improve… but hey its my first week!

i would then make the div (with class menu) fixed. Then centering an unordered list seems a bit tricky, but i simply googled that and got to:
.menu {
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 3;
  z-index: 3;
  background-color: rgb(69, 19, 78);
  top: 0;
}
.menu ul {
  display: table;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

also, anchor elements (<a></a>) won’t inherit color
bonus recommendation:
html, body {
  margin: 0;
} 

to overwrite the default body margin (most browsers have this)

yayyy!!!
thanks a lot!!!

181,Ravenous Part 3 - Task 8 JS /CSS relationship clarification,"Get Help,CSS",general,3,"
Hello,
Just finished the Ravenous Part 3 and after a second look, I have noticed the intricate relationship between the JS and CSS which left a bit confused. Task 8 to be more specific.
First of all look at the SearchBar.js within the render /return section of code of the SearchBar class. The div with the className ‘SearchBar-sort-options’ is styling in CSS the ul and li and all the active and hover effects of the lis under the same className ‘SearchBar-sort-options’ .

SearchBar@js1906×1019 117 KB

SearchBar.js

SearchBar@css1901×1017 97.8 KB

SearchBar.css
Second of all, the renderSortByOptions method is taking a className attribute which styles the li items dynamically with the help of getSortByClass method.
It might sound obvious for some, but how does the li recognize the ‘SearchBar-sort-options’ name in CSS, despite the fact that the className in renderSortByOptions method is not even mentioning it.
Thank you,
","
I think you are over complicating things.
first off, in searchBar.js, the render() methods returns html with classes. These classes are recognized by css. There isn’t any complicated happening here.
the only thing getSortByClass does is adding a class active or no class ('')
again, this classes are already defined in css, so when the browser renders this html, the styling is applied by the browser (just like a static html & css website)

Sir, thanks for the heads up. It makes more sense when not complicating things.

182,How can I change this CSS layout from horizontal to vertical?,"Get Help,CSS",general,2,"

184,Navigation Bar has two problems flex-direction and display,"Get Help,CSS",box-model,1,"
Hello! I was trying to make this in code and I really need help. I wrote the html and css for a navigation bar and here I have two problems. First, I need to put another navigation bar with social media icons right above this one, I thought of using flex box but it doesn’t work because one appears next to the other instead of above. The second problem is that to be responsive, I need for screen sizes of less than 768px to see the navigation bar as a dropdown menu, for this I used flex-direction: column, but what happens is that both navigation bars the horizontal and dropdown appear with a screen size of less than 768, and then in fullsize screen I cannot see anyone of them. I hope this is clear enough and that someone can help me. Thank you.

185,Nested Element question,"Get Help,CSS",general,3,"
Hello.
During ‘CSS setup and selectors’ tutorial - Ch.13 Nested Elements, the class attribute comes before the h5 tag: .description h5 {…}.
However, previously in Ch.12 Chaining Selectors, the class attribute came after the h2 tag: h2.description {…}. Why is this so? I thought the class attribute came before the tag according to the rule of Specificity.
","
Good question.  I am a little confused myself!  I am wondering if it doesn’t matter.  I am thinking I have done both.  Maybe that can be answered as well.  Have you tried doing it both ways to see if anything changed?

.description h5 and h2.description work very differently.
description h5 will target all level 5 header elements which have a element with class description as parent:
<h5>i am not targeted</h5>
<div class=""description"">
   <h5>i am targeted</h5>
</div>

where as h2.description targets all level 2 header elements with class description:
<h2>i am not targeted</h2>
<h2 class=""description"">i am targeted</h2>
<div class=""description"">
   <h2>i am not targeted</h2>
   <h2 class=""description"">i am targeted</h2>

Hi sandraagor,



 sandraagor:

To have the title of the page in the middle


In your styles.css add display: flex; line to  .banner-text span { } rule-set.

Again in your style sheet file add display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; lines to .container { } rule-set.

When creating a responsive website is it possible or a good idea to have additional .css dedicated for sizing.  I’ve noticed that my .css document has gotten quite lengthy since working on the capstone project.

It is very much possible to use multiple css files. You could split up css into commonly shared styling for a whole website and then use a separate css file for page specific styling.

Thank you. that makes sense.

The early web would have its difficulties, latency, among them. Notwithstanding that latency still exists, in technical terms, the overall speed of the web has so improved that us early users wouldn’t think there was any.
We did use multiple CSS files so that any style sheets not required were not loaded. There is a benefit to this. The home page loads with minimal style rules and images, etc., to make the initial download near instant. As features of the page are accessed by the user, their content comes in with its own style sheet.
Likewise, as we traverse the site, pages pull down an auxilliary style sheet and perhaps one that applies to, ‘thispage.css’.
There may be provisos to using CSS @import but then, we have a really fast web that more than mitigates them. That means we can initiate the fastest downloading file, and have it import the default(s). This builds a cascade that ends up in the correct order.
imported css
imported css
css for this page

The bottom line in all of this is that as long as there are no changes in the source files, then each new component will have been cached. Subsequent visits will not need these downloads. We have effectively used progressive introduction of additional styling.

Precluding this would be a file structure that supports layering.
+ site_root/
  - index.html
  + css/
    - default.css
  + js/
  + images/
  + feature/
    - index.html    // <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""thispage.css"">
    - thispage.css  // which then imports ""/css/default.css""

191,CSS flexbox project,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,2,"
Hello everyone happy friday from Madrid,
New topic, new problem. I am having issues with flex properties. When I apply it to my div it goes above the margin of the div and I can’t fix it, meaning that I can’t and don’t know how to properly align them how I want. In this case 3 images top and 2 images down inside of their parent div margin. With this said if somebody can take a look at the code and give a hint of what could be wrong here? Thanks!
Flex Box Project link 
","
Before we get to what the possible issues may be, please consider these style guide pointers…
<header class = ""header"">

HTML is not like script or programming code. Because it is generally much more verbose we tend to avoid whitespace.
<header class=""header"">

The only space character(s) is(are) the one(s) preceding the attribute name.
While browsers are fairly reliable in the recognition of an unquoted attribute values, markup without quotes is not upwardly compatible with stricter XML rules. We can avoid this by never writing attributes without quotes. Booleans are another animal.
<img src=img/img-tea-cozy-logo.png alt=""Tea Cozy Logo"">

versus,
 <img src=""img/img-tea-cozy-logo.png"" alt=""Tea Cozy Logo"">

We would never leave empty the most important element in the page…
<title></title>

versus,
<title>Tea Cozy</title>

There is a secondary concern with one of the elements mentioned above…
<header class=""header"">

There is enough information in the TYPE to be able to select this element. Do we need a class attribute? Only when there is more than one <header> element in the page do we need to single it out. TYPE selectors have the lowest specificity, so should be the base selectors before dialing in to a particular element.
If we know we only have one HEADER, then,
header {

}

is as much rule as we need. We can still dial in to the child elements…
header {

}
header h1 {

}
header h2 {

}
header nav {

}

The latter assumes the page nav is inside the header which may not normally be the case, but there is no hard rule against it. We can still isolate from the rest of the document with that simple combinator selector.

192,Centring some divs,"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,3,"
Hi All,
I have tried various fixes but can’t center the container divs in the middle of the screen. Please help. The link below is to the project.
[link in profile]
","
One immediate fix will be in the following,
.container {
  display: inline-block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 80%;
  max-height: 30%;
  margin: 20px auto ;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

to change,

display: inline-block;

to,

text-align: center;

It should be noted that padding will stretch a container on the axis to which it is applied. The following stretches on both axes…
  padding: 10px;

For better control, I suggest not using padding on the horizontal axis.
padding: 10px 0;

If we look at the selector rules for the six color ids the thing that stands out is they each have but one difference, the background-color. That means we can write a selector rule that can apply to all of them, and write all the properties only once.
<div class=""container"">
  <div id=""colors"">
    <p id=""yellow"">yellow <br>#FFFF47</p>
    <p id=""light-orange"">light-orange<br>#F17F29</p>
    <p id=""dark-orange"">dark-orange<br>#F96900</p>
    <p id=""green"">green<br>#2A7A00</p>
    <p id=""turquoise"">turquoise<br>#E5FCFF</p>
    <p id=""blue"">blue<br>#2D99FF</p>
  </div>
</div>

#colors p {
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  min-width:10%;
  min-height: 200px;
  color: blue;
}
#yellow {
  background-color: #FFFF47;
}
/* etc. */

When you get into scripting, you’ll find backgroundColor is the property we use to change the color. However it will not override background so that property should not be used unless it is more descriptive than just the color.
Eg.
background: #fff url(background-image.png) 50% 50% cover no-repeat fixed;

That’s just an example. As mentioned, the background color is not the same as, background-color: #fff. Were we to want to dynamically change the background color, we would need to replicate the property above in its entirety else we would lose the other property values.
The above is a kind of down the road exercise, but I would suggest studying shorthand rules versus explicit properties. There is a time to use shorthand, and there are times not to. There may be drawbacks in some cases.

Wow, thank you so much for the help I’m going to amend the code now. I have only been learning HTML and CSS for about 2 month so still have a long way to go. Thanks again!

193,How to switch black and white colors using CSS filters?,"Get Help,CSS",selectors-visual,3,"
For example, if we have the image below:

What “filter” in CSS can I use to switch the colors, that is: make background black and image content (in this case, we have “Word”) white. I’m not sure if a property other than “filter” is needed
I want to use this for the “Night mode” feature
","
There is an invert filter that should do the trick. Let us know what you find out.

@mtf is correct:
documentation is here



MDN Web Docs



invert()
The invert() CSS function inverts the color samples in the input image. Its result is a filter-function.

194,Website Design Project [HELP WITH POSITIONING AND DISPLAY],"Get Help,CSS",display-positioning,7,"
Hello everyone, hope you are having a great weekend.
I am having a hard one here because I don’t have the concepts of display, positioning and box elements very clear.
I fail every single time that I want to move an element on my code.
For example in this project I need to create 3 borders with more boxes inside simple.
The problem comes when I want to use block, inline and block-inline. I don’t know when to use them neither display.
I will attach until I have come so far for the last 2 days (this makes me feel very sad and frustrating because it’s a simple exercise and I can accomplish it).
I feel like I shouldn’t move on from here until I master this part of the course.
my main questions are:

The yellow box why moved a little but up more than the other ones.
Why I fail moving the font boxes around.
How can I set the margins of the page so everything looks proper and nice.
How can I make the content of the page not shrink when I reduce the size of the browser?

FYI:
I HAD TO COPY AND PASTE THE CODE BECAUSE THE LINK TO SHARE WON’T LOAD…
I speak Spanish so this time (of many attempts) I tried setting the names in spanish to see if it was easier for me to understand what I am doing.
If I did things that are unnecessary like overcreating divs and classes or id’s… whatever I am not doing right feel free to tell me (I need this help).
Also I am doing it this exercise on Sublime Text and I just pasted everything on the CodeAcademy website to give you guys the link.
Thank you for your help and hope to hear from you VERY SOON.

The problem comes when I want to use block, inline and block-inline. I don’t know when to use them


The last one, inline-block is only ever used when we wish to override the default display property of an element.  For instance, DIVs stack up on one another and take the full width of the viewport, by default. When we declare them as inline blocks then they line up side-by-side , with a slight margin between (~2px)See [1] below. Inline elements on the other hand have no left and right margins, so if we wish to give them margins, we can alter their display property so that they inherit some of the block level properties they didn’t previously have.
The nice thing about inline-block is that it has no default width, and takes that from its content. Being block elements, though, we can define a set width for all the blocks in a row, or give them all common padding, centering, etc. with a single selector rule.
Play around with this to confirm the above information.
<div>block</div>
<div>block .</div>
<div>block . .</div>
<div>block . . .</div>
<div>block . . . .</div>

Give these a border property, and nothing else. View in the browser.
Now give them a text-align property set to center. View in the browser.
Next give them a width property set to say, 5em. View in the browser.
Next, give them a line-height property set to 2em, and view in the browser.
Finally, give them a display property set to inline-block, and view in the browser.
See any difference between the steps? You can move the display property up the list in these steps to see it play out differently. Definitely play with it.
Let’s do the same with some inline elements, we’ll use SPAN…
<span>inline</span>
<span>inline .</span>
<span>inline . .</span>
<span>inline . . .</span>
<span>inline . . . .</span>

This time, instead of a border, let’s give them a background-color property set to say, gold. View in the browser.
Try giving them a width property, then view in the browser.
Next try giving them a line-height property, and view in the browser.
Go ahead and given them a text-align property, and view in the browser.
Anything happen yet?
Now give them a display property set to inline-block. Should be some change, now.
Please give us a screenshot of what you see in the final steps of the above. I’m not visualizing this, at present, only suggesting some tests to run. Let us know how it goes and if you are getting more comfortable with inline-block.

These questions were set aside momentarily so that your first concern could be addressed. Hopefully we hit the mark, and you have had enough time to explore inline-block, especially in the documentation.
The first two questions will need a working example. Can you create a repl that we can fork so we don’t have to create one with your code? I’d rather fork your code than start a new repl with it. That way it stays your code. repl.it is free to sign up and use. I like it because it is simple and straight forward. I’m not one for bells and whistles.
Number 3 is accomplished with a page wrapper being one approach.
<body>
<div id=""wrapper"">
  <!-- all sectioning elements in here -->
</div>
</body>

If we consider the document as a sheet of A5 paper, we can assign the margins, background, and other generic properties to this selector.
#wrapper {
  width: 95%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  color: #151404;
  background-color: #f0eaaf;
}

Now that we have a left and right edge, we can hug the borders with our content containers. A lot of the time we can use inline-block as above, with the grouping container given a text-align: center property. [2]
There are simple ways to create the bare rendering that will contain the document. The simpler, the better, imho.
The last question is actually quite complex. What content is shrinking?
An adaptive page allows for various viewport and device widths without a horizontal scrollbar until very narrow. The font size should not be affected.
A responsive page should still have an underlying adaptive layout, then additionally, media queries that conditionally set things like font size, image size, and other display properties.
Perhaps I am not totally clear on the specifics of this question, so the above ramble is a basic response more than an answer.


2.
Witness this subtle change to our sample repl…
section:nth-child(1),
section:nth-child(2) {
  text-align: center;
}



line and inline-block elements examples
HELLO!!! I am so so happy to start a monday like this.
Yes the I understood the concepts but this examples are helping me a lot. I attached what I am doing on repl.it.
The inline elements width and height didn’t change until I changed the way they displayed to inline-block.
The second example

Again MTF thank you so much for answering like you always do, you are amazing. That being said, I am attaching the same code that I used for this question but on repl.it
https://repl.it/@Georgesgj/Website-Design-Example
The last two questions I think will be answered in the next chapter that I just started called Responsive web design.

Looking at the CSS in repl example from this post reveals some redundancy (repetition). The only difference between the four boxes is their background color.
.color-azul {
	border: 1px solid black;
	height: 100px;
	width: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	background-color: blue;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 0 10px;
	text-align: center;
	font-weight: bold;
}

.color-rojo {
	border: 1px solid black;
	height: 100px;
	width: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	background-color: red;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 0 10px;
	text-align: center;
	font-weight: bold;
}

.color-amarillo {
	border: 1px solid black;
	height: 100px;
	width: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	background-color: yellow;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 0px 10px;
	text-align: center;
	font-weight: bold;

}

.color-morado {
	border: 1px solid black;
	height: 100px;
	width: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	background-color: purple;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 0 10px;
	text-align: center;
	font-weight: bold;
}

may be reduced to,
#colores div {
	border: 1px solid black;
	height: 100px;
	width: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 0 10px;
	text-align: center;
	font-weight: bold;
}
.color-azul {
	background-color: blue;
}
.color-rojo {
	background-color: red;
}
.color-amarillo {
	background-color: yellow;
}
.color-morado {
	background-color: purple;
}

Over to the second example. Will reply if I have more to add.
As for the question about the yellow box, it has to do with the text wrapping to a second line. The fix is,
width: 190px;
padding: 20px 0;

The padding is removed from left and right and the 40px added to the width. It’s worth noting that the box height is set to 100px, but the actual height due to padding is 140px.

I have been playing around with columns and flex-boxes for a couple months, while flex-boxes are easy to deal with when having a responsive layout (@media), in my opinion they can be difficult to control.
I just fell in love with the grid system, but I’m not sure where to start to make it “responsive-happy.”  Here’s my code, which doesn’t work correctly on an iphone…

198,How to stop content from overflowing in floated boxes?,"Get Help,CSS",box-model,8,"
Hello!
I am trying to build a comment section box in HTML and CSS. For that, I am using a floated thumbnail of the user. And I have set the overflow property to hidden so that the comment text clears the thumbnail image horizontally.
The problem is, the comment text overflows out of the box. I need a fix so that the user can scroll through the comment instead of it overflowing and making it look messy.
Please excuse me for my inaccurate and incomplete description as I’ve just started with HTML and CSS.

I’m not getting overflow like in the screenshot when I try out your code. Can you please post the entire html file? Thanks!

Oh, sure I can. Even I am unable to notice any anomalies in my code but the browser rendition tells a different story.
I am uploading both HTML and CSS files here. Please have a look. Thank you.

P.S. I have renamed the file extension to .txt as HTML and CSS files cannot be uploaded.

        purus cursus dictum ornare a phasellus. A augue venenatis adipiscing.</p>

One way around this is to give username and comment a wrapper div.
    <div class='avatar'></div>
    <div class=""user-comment"">
        <h3 class='username'>Bob Smith</h3>
        <p class='comment'></p>
    </div>

Give that div a float property as well as width: auto

As I’ve said earlier I want to hide those comments from overflowing out of the box (maybe add a scroll bar if the comments get too long).
I tried doing as you suggested. But you might wanna take a look at the result. Both the comment and username fall below the actual comment box.

Thanks for the help.
P.S: Doing something like this is pretty simple using flexbox. But are these kinds of problems actually very tricky to to solve with floats? And should I avoid using it too often?




 jss0:

But are these kinds of problems actually very tricky to to solve with floats?


Yes, floats are tricky to contain, and often need more structure and tweaking. It’s been ages since I explored them so am starting from scratch, again.
I did get this to work, without adding any more floats, just by controling the margins and heights. The heading and the comment need to be in a container, and oddly, the only property I gave the container is overflow:hidden.

      <div class=""column"">
        <div class='avatar'></div>
<div class=""user-comment"">

      </div>

.avatar {
  border: 1px solid red;
  float: left;
  width: 60px;
  height: 60px;
  margin-top: 25px;
  margin-left: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #d6e9fe;
}
.username {
  margin: 10px;
  border: 1px solid green;
}
.comment {
  border: 1px solid blue;
  margin: 10px;
  height: 110px;
  max-height: 110px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.user-comment {
  overflow: hidden;
}


Aha! This solves the problem. Thanks for taking the time out for this.
I’ve been reading some articles over floats and find that flexbox and grid have taken over floats for most of the purposes and floats have become kind of obsolete (except for few edge cases and legacy browser support).
I think floats are a hacky and inelegant way to build grids or any layout for that matter. So I guess I’ll have to avoid it as well.
And thanks again.

Because padding influences the content of an element, not the styling.

Has to do with the width of your div with class learning-words. 75% is too wide making it go over the screen width and causing overflow.
Btw I noticed there is only one element with class learning-words, a class implies there are multiple elements that require the same styling. If there is only one instance, use and id tag instead.




 janneslohmeijer:

a class implies there are multiple elements that require the same styling. If there is only one instance, use and id tag instead.


Are you sure this is true ? I have learned to only use classes unless i am for certain a element can only be used once.
Also a class does not implie that there are multiple elements with that styling. It only implies that there could be multiple elements with that styling.
Changing something to id because it is only used once at “that” moment is risky cause later you might need to change it back. Gets even worse when there is also javascript attached to the id.
Beside’s other developers that work with your product can’t use that styling since it would be an id and not a class.

Thank you for the help.  It worked!
you mentioned that I was only using one element under the class learning-words.  Are you saying that since I only used that way of styling once throughout the styling page that I should use an ID vs class instead?

Well there seem to be different opinions on the matter, read @biirra’s post above.
Whether you use a class or an id tag doesn’t really matter since the result is the same. However with a class you can style multiple elements and with an id tag only 1.
Therefore I personally use id tags for those items where I need to specifically style it. And I use classes if I know a certain styling will be applied to multiple elements. But that’s my personal taste and ‘style’ I guess.  BTW That doesn’t mean you can’t use both on a single element.

That makes sense.  I see a logic in the way you described it.  I have two other question regarding this project.
In my heading section the cyan boxes do no reach the top of the page.  Why is that?
and on the practice section my border is not extending all the way down.  Again why is that?




 vernonsyncere:

In my heading section the cyan boxes do no reach the top of the page. Why is that?


This is because your body has a set default margin. If you want to maintain the white space left and right of your grey border but want the top to be flush with the screen give your body a margin-top of 0.



 vernonsyncere:

and on the practice section my border is not extending all the way down. Again why is that?


Your border is not running all the way down due to your h1 text in the start-container. It has a default margin-top. Once again give that particular element a margin-top of 0 and you are good to go.

Thank you for offering you insight.  I appreciate the different perspective.

Thank you.  That makes sense now.  I was trying margin-top in all the other elements and boxes but didn’t think to do those.  Happy to know I wasn’t too far off. Thanks again

Are you familiar with the inspector? When viewing the page in pretty much any browser you can do right-click -> inspect element, which opens the inspector. You can scroll through each element and see the margins and padding visualized on screen.

I used it a bit but I’m seeing now to it’s truest potential

202,CSS Selectors hierarchy,"Get Help,CSS",,6,"
I’m in the CSS basic course, step 12 “Chaining Selectors” and it states:

Chaining Selectors

When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.
This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a  .special  class for  h1  elements, the CSS would look like:
In the previous step it mentioned that IDs are the most specific and will override all other selectors. Is it possible to chain id and class selectors together, or even all 3 to keep CSS formating to a very specific area when id, class, and tag selectors all share a common line of code?
","
Well, chaining IDs with classes is not necessary since there is only one HTML element with that particular ID tag. You can however chain classes to target specific elements. Even more so there are even CSS selectors that can for example select the next sibling of an element or the first parent.
For a complete list of selectors go here ;).
The only reason I can think of to chain a class to an ID is in the case that you have multiple elements of a certain tag under a div with an ID.
Say you have two sections with separate IDs yet the child elements are of the same class but you want to implement only one difference ( i.e. font colour).
The HTML:
<div id='parent1'>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
</div>

<div id='parent2'>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
     <div class=""child""></div>
</div>

The CSS:
.child {   /* Targets all elements with a class of .child */ 
   font-size: 20px;
   text-align: center;
   font-weight: bold;
   color: blue;
}

#parent2 .child { /* Only targets the elements with a class of .child which are children of the div element with an ID of #parent2 */
   color: red;
}

Does this answer your question?

To add to this section which I might have misunderstood previously, if you have multiple elements you would like to give the same css attribute value you can combine them using a comma like so.
h1, h2, #header1, .subtext {
    color: blue;
}

203,Why would I need to use to an element instead of a class?,"Get Help,CSS",general,8,"
In this exercise.
What is the case in which I need to use an ID to an element instead of simply using a specific class for that element?
","
I think it could be a small oversight in the lesson preparation. It makes sense if before we add the id attribute, the element looks like this…
<h1 class=""title cursive uppercase"">Top Vacation Spots</h1>

Notice I changed the ‘capitalize’ to ‘uppercase’. Now run the code.
Okay, add the CSS, (it can go on the bottom of the style sheet)
#article-title {
  font-family: cursive;
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

and insert the attribute so the element now looks like this…
<h1 id=""article-title"" class=""title cursive uppercase"">Top Vacation Spots</h1>

Now we can see how because of greater specificity, the capitalize property overrides the ‘uppercase’ class.

Thanks for your reply.
It’s still not clear for me why do we have to create an id instead of creating another class.
For instance:
<h1 class=""title cursive uppercase"">Top Vacation Spots</h1>
We want to change it to capitalize? why not do this:
<h1 class=""title cursive capitalize"">Top Vacation Spots</h1>
where we define:
.capitalize {
text-transform: capitalize;
}

They are two ways to achieve the same result. However, there are numerous situations where an id is so much better to use because of its specificity.
For example:
Say you have 3 divs with a background image where everything is the same except for the image source. You could then assign those divs with the same class to get the display settings, but make the image source id dependent.
<div id=""image1"" class=""background-image"">
    ...
</div>

<div id=""image2"" class=""background-image"">
   ...
</div>

<div id=""image3"" class=""background-image"">
   ...
</div>

.background-image {
     background-repeat: no-repeat;
     background-attachment: fixed;
     background-position: center; 
}

#image1 {
    background-image: url(""img_tree.gif"");
}

#image2 {
    background-image: url(""img_rock.gif"");
}

#image3 {
    background-image: url(""img_mountain.gif"");
}


Thanks for the reply!
I’m sorry if I’m asking too much about this but in your example why can’t we write it like this:
<div class=""background-image image1"">
    ...
</div>

<div class=""background-image image2"">
   ...
</div>

<div class=""background-image image2"">
   ...
</div>

And then specify the image source in each class:
.background-image {
     background-repeat: no-repeat;
     background-attachment: fixed;
     background-position: center; 
}

.image1 {
    background-image: url(""img_tree.gif"");
}

.image2 {
    background-image: url(""img_rock.gif"");
}

.image3 {
    background-image: url(""img_mountain.gif"");
}

What’s the case in which specificity is crucially needed?

In cases where we need a specific image that is not going to be used again on the same page then id is ideal for the usage.
<div id=""image1"" class=""bg"">
    ...
</div>

.bg {
    background-color: #fff;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center; 
    background-size: cover;
}
#image1 {
  backgound-image: url(img_tree.gif)
}
#image2 {
  backgound-image: url(img_rock.gif)
}
#image3 {
  backgound-image: url(img_mountain.gif)
}


Sure you can do it like that, same result. But is not the most attractive solution.
Using a class implies that there are multiple of the same elements or multiple elements that will need the same styling. If there is code that you only want applied to a single item, use an ID tag.
Aids in readability big time and might save you a lot of time later on when building in animations using for example Javascript.

I got it!
Thanks a lot for your response.

Hi,
I was in the middle of the exercise above, on the 4th step I change the display property value to ‘block’ but I can’t really understand why… it doesn’t seem like it changes something.
Furthermore, as far as I recall, the display property is inherited, so I tried to change the display property of the container to ‘block’, expecting to see both images in the footer each on its own line, but that also didn’t work.
any reason that’s the case? thanks!

Hey there @anightingale, welcome to the forums!



 anightingale:

I was wondering if there was a quick explanation for the purpose of format(‘example’); after the URL when linking in fonts using the @font-face property in CSS.


Good question.
There’s a few ways that you can introduce a new typeface, or font, in to your CSS.
One way is to use a web-based resource, like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. They provide you with a pre-prepared block of code to add to your HTML to include the font, or fonts, you want to use.
If, say, you don’t want to rely on a third-party to provide the font - let’s say you’ve designed a great typeface of your own which you want to use - you can host the font files locally on your web server and serve them from there.
In that case, since we’re hosting the fonts locally on the server, we can include the font with the @font-face declaration in the CSS and point the src attribute to the appropriate font file. Like so:
@font-face {
  font-family: ""Roboto"";
  src: url(fonts/Roboto.woff2) format('woff2'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.woff) format('woff'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.tff) format('truetype');
}

The reason we need to include format('woff2'), for example, is because fonts come in a variety of formats. In the code segment above, we’re including the Roboto font, and providing three different formats for the browser to choose from - woff2 and woff are Web Open Font Format files, and truetype is a TrueType font. (There’s also an OpenType format.)
You need to tell the browser what format the font is in, because not all browsers support all font formats. For example, to the best of my knowledge right now, neither Internet Explorer nor Safari support WOFF2 fonts so you need an alternative - like WOFF, or TrueType.
Hope that explains it a bit better, but if you’re still confused (or I’ve made it worse) let us know.

208,Linking the CSS file - help please,"Get Help,CSS",,4,"
Hi all,
I’m currently doing the following exercise:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-setup-selectors/exercises/link-html-css?action=resume_content_item
In the exercise I have my style sheet, and I link it in the HTML, however the output has no change.
Here’s what I have in my head:
<head>
<link href=""./style.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
  <title>Vacation World</title>
  
</head>

Thinking it may be the href that I am getting wrong, I’ve also tried just typing “style.css” and also “https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css” however neither of these make any changes either.
This is what is in my style sheet style.css:
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
  </style>

The exercise lets me continue and acknowledged that I got each part of the instructions “correct” however I am concerned that by not understanding what I am doing wrong here, I am missing out on learning something valuable.
Thank you for any assistance.
EDIT:
I’ve experimented by adding this to my style.css:
  <style>
p {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Arial;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Arial;
}
  </style>

Sure enough, the text in my h1 changed to blue, and is written in arial. However the text in my p is still black, and still in whatever the default font is.
Thanks again for any assistance.
EDIT 2 - SOLVED
If any other newbies has this issue, I’ve found that what is causing it to happen is that in my .css file I had it start with  and with with  which are not supposed to be there and are causing the issue.

You can insert this tag in the <head> section of your HTML file:

In order to determine what the filepath to your css file is, you need to determine where your html file is relative to your css file. Consider the four scenarios (NOTE: folderName and cssFilename are the names of your folders and css file):

Hi Chih (@4549416579)
This question has been nicely explained by Tod (@midlindner)




The CSS quiz on advanced grids got me confused CSS


    There is a css grid property called grid-auto-flow. If unassigned, it assumes row. When an html element is added, and the predefined grid (in this case 2 rows and 2 columns) can’t contain it, the grid implicitly adds a new row which receives the grid-auto-rows value for it’s height. In the second question the 5th element is still added to an implicitly added new row, but into the original explicitly defined 1st column, so it gets the width of the grid-template-columns. If, we added grid-auto-flo…
  


Just got beaten by @zainabrawat, but I was already working  on an explanation.
As you can see in the image, since a template was made to determine the grid for the first 4 boxes, the 5th box is placed under it, and since the width of a column has already be defined in the template it will inherit that width.

Please furnish a screenshot to illustrate the effect, if you have not already solved this.
<button type=""submit"">Sign Up</button>

Just a thought:
Since your form does have an action, you could just use an input control with a submit type.
input[type=submit] {

}

You can still style it, but it should remain an inline element so it stays on the same line as the other controls.

Is your server configured to parse HTML as PHP by default? How else would that page be able to handle the POSTDATA in the query string?

 pmolina1:

I am having trouble aligning a list in the middle of two images using CSS.


Use the align=“center” feature right in the tag.
<ul align=""center"">
  <li>Goods</li>
</ul>

Moves everything to the center exempt for the bullet point , but it works.
If you just want simple CSS, here it is to center the list:
ul {
  text-align: center;
}

Same thing with the dot on the very left though. I don’t think there is a solution using that tag to fix it.
I hope this helps =)
P.S. You pust your list there instead of goods

Hey pmolina1,
The key to what you are trying to achieve is to give all three elements a property of display: inline-block and make sure their widths total are not exceeding the width of the parent element. Or contain the items in three separate parent containers and apply the same as mentioned above. You could achieve this by hard coding sizes or using percentages of the parent element.
I would so something like this:
<div id='professional-phylosophy'>
   <div id='picture-left'>
       <img scr=""image1...""/>
   </div>
   <div id='text-and-list'>
       <h1>My Professional Phylosophy</h1>
       <ul>
            <li>....</li>
            <li>....</li>
            <li>....</li>
       </ul>
   </div>
   <div id='picture-left'>
       <img scr=""image2...""/>
   </div>
</div>

And then in the CSS:
#professional-phylosophy {
    width: 100%;
    min-size: whatever you like;
    max-size: whatever you like;
}
#picture-left, #picture-right, #text-and-list {
   width: 33%;
   display: inline-block;
}

And syle the contents of these div containers as you like.
Hope this helps

214,Why Does Codecademy Use IDs Instead Of Classes?,"Get Help,CSS",,8,"
I have taken several other courses and read several advanced books on CSS as well as studying naming conventions like BEM and read many industry blogs like css-tricks.
Across the board, it is said to be best practice to use classes for CSS, and save IDs for JS (of course there are a few exceptions). Classes can be reused, IDs can’t.
But Codecademy is teaching us to use IDs where classes should be used. WHY IS THIS?
This makes me concerned about all the courses in the curriculum. I’d rather spend my time learning best practices instead of having to unlearn them later.
Can someone from Codecademy address this? I’m on the free trial and don’t want to sign up for the year if I don’t hear a good answer about this…
","
Technologies are constantly evolving and best practices along with it. Most every lesson is just designed to get your feet wet. You aren’t actually hurting your development by learning an outdated or different way.
In school they told me I was learning C++ - NOPE! I learned C! Technically it was c++ but it was taught as if the language were C. On my own I went out and learned how to write in a more cpp idiomatic way - but knowing that C was essential.


You aren’t actually hurting your development by learning an outdated or different way.

hmmmm… debatable…

You’ll look back at this and laugh and laugh if you stick with coding.
You are WAY too deep into the SMALL stuff that you shouldn’t sweat.
Will your hard drive get deleted if you use an ID instead of a class?
What will be the actual measured outcome?
You should be worrying about how to use programming to solve problems.

@rootbeer7, you have a good point about this, and I have passed it on to people with more power then myself.

Hey @fight_dragons!
Technically you are correct; this isn’t a code breaking error. But I can understand why @rootbeer7 would be worried about this. If the lesson is being taught correctly, then it should be fixed.

Hi @rootbeer7. @fight_dragons makes some excellent points, the fundamental knowledge you are learning is no different whether IDs or classes are used. And there are so many different “industry standards” that change so often you need to be a me to quickly adapt.
The fact that CC uses a different standard to some industries current best practices will help you learn to adapt as the industry moves and grows on.
For other topics we need to be really careful to ensure best practices are used and bad techniques quickly stamped out, but in this case being adaptable will help you more in the long run. Steven has passed the feedback on though so no need to make a bug report.

I am surprised to learn about this, when I did the intensive (paid course, discontinued now), ‘Build website from scratch (2017)’, it was specifically mentioned not to use id if class could do the job. This is what was there in one of the lessons , ‘Classes and IDs’, Since IDs override class and tag styles, they should be used sparingly and only on elements that need to always appear the same.

Hello Lizzy!



 boardpro50944:

I don’t understand why with background-image: cover, the image whole image doesn’t appear when I exceed a certain browser window width.


Maybe it only shows the whole thing within a certain width. Does it work on a regular screen?

no when I open my window in big, you can’t see the bottom half of the picture.
When you size your screen as a mobile size, you see the whole background image of the jumbotron.
I don’t understand because it is set to
background-size: cover
in the original CSS given by code academy.

got it!
there is the snippet of code that allows the image to be responsive and still seen in its entirety whatever the screen width:
background-position: center
because the default position of the background image is top left!

Hey @paine8887,
I didnt check all the code but here are two things I noticed straight away.
You put your media queries in front of your default attributes. I suggest always putting them at the rear because CSS is loaded in and implemented top to bottom.
Also (this might actually be the cause of it not working), this query is not closed off:
@media all and (min-width: 500px;) {

.main-div {
  width: 85%;
  margin: 100px auto;

Hi!
In many sources I’ve read priority of a tag is higher than class.
But this code displays vice versa. (heading should be green, but it’s red!)
Please explain me why. Sorry for my english.

Hi, Welcome to the forums.
CSS that is more specific will be applied with higher priority (so to speak).
So for example if you have the following heading:
<h5 id=""test"" class=""description"">Top Attractions</h5>

And the CSS:
.description {
  	color: blue;
}

h5 {
	color: red;
}

#test {
	color: orange;
}

The CSS will be applied from the least specific to the most specific in this order:
tag    >    class             > id
h5     >    .description      > #test

In this scenario, the h5 is the least specific as it means ALL h5 elements. Then you get the class, as classes can be applied to more than 1 element of the website (for example all of the headings).
Lastly you get the id. This is a value that has to be a unique value in the html document and is thus also the most specific of the 3. It points to a certain html element.
With this in mind, in the above scenario, the “Top Attractions” h5 element will be orange.
When the id is removed as follows:
<h5 class=""description"">Top Attractions</h5>

This will result in the heading text being blue because the class is now more specific to this element.

TLDR: In your case, the h5 CSS is more specific than the class of the parent div, hence the heading is red.




 beta5773653430:

In many sources I’ve read priority of a tag is higher than class.


Please point us to one of those sources. Perhaps the wording is not easy to clearly understand.
TYPE selectors have the lowest specificity, meaning they are the least important of all the selectors, along with their counterpart, pseudo-type selectors.
0    0    0    1

Consider this as a table of specificity, with TYPE being the right most column. Class is the column next to that, moving to the left.
0    0    1    0

That also includes pseudo-classes.
ID is next on the left…
0    1    0    0

and STYLE (the attribute) is the leftmost, or highest specificity.
We do have a trump card, !important but that should be used only as a last resort, and should be resolved so it does not have to live in the production style sheet. If we must resort to using it, that generally means there is a cascade issue or an inline style that the external styles cannot override.

In this project, where is ‘square’ class in  html code??

This element:

has two classes - task and square.

Then writing “hello wrold” has two classes both hello and square??

Element with this attribute:
class=""hello world""

would have two classes - hello and world, yes.

Really thanks to your reply @factoradic!

You’re very welcome 

So if we have this element:
<div class=""task square""></div>

And this is the content of our stylesheet:
.square {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
}

.task {
    background-color: red;
}

Then the element will be a red square.

Hey @hanbhin,
That does not really matter as longs at the element you want to show on top has the highest number.
Note, z-index only works with items which are outside of the html flow. (i.e. position: fixed).
More info on that:

222,-webkit -moz-box,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
Okay, I’m learning CSS and we just covered the need to reset the style sheet of the browser. Looking at some examples I have found these resets most often on the websites that I work on:
html,
input[type=“search”]{
-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
-moz-box-sizing:    border-box;
box-sizing:         border-box;
}
Now I realize what is happening here. We are telling specific browsers to reset. However, I have noticed that “webkit” is used elsewhere in stylesheets other than simply in resets.
What is webkit / moz-box? Are these libraries? I tried to research this on my own, if you do a search for “css webkit” there is literally nothing about it.
Can someone better explain these terms for me?
","
These rules are for specific browser engines. Sometimes the regular rule does not work and it is necessary to call for the specific browser engine.
-webkit is used by browsers, mail clients etc developed by Apple such as Safari.
-moz refers to the browser engine by Mozilla who have developed Firefox.

This concept is known as vendor prefixes. This MDN article might shed some light -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix.

Thank you, that’s why I couldn’t find anything describing the specific terms, I didn’t know that they were referred to as “vendor prefixes”
So basically, these prefixes allow us to use “hacks” that are not part of the CSS “official” vocabulary, but presumably may be in the future?
So, how do we know, or how do these prefixes know how to define the non-standard css rules? Does Apple and Moz know about these terms and include them into the css of their browsers?

Awesome question! 
All the big companies that create web browsers - Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla are dealing a huge part in the standardization process of HTML and CSS. CSS is still evolving and when there is a high probability that a new feature will become a part of the CSS standard - these companies are aware of this fact. That is why vendor prefixes were introduced - as a way to introduce the implementation of non-standard features that might make it into the standard or of features that are part of the standard, but the current implementation of them is too tricky / hacky and is planned to be strongly refactored.
But vendor prefixes are slowly disappearing. Take a look at this note from the article I linked earlier:

Browser vendors are working to stop using vendor prefixes for experimental features. Web developers have been using them on production Web sites, despite their experimental nature. This has made it more difficult for browser vendors to ensure compatibility and to work on new features; it’s also been harmful to smaller browsers who wind up forced to add other browsers’ prefixes in order to load popular web sites.
Lately, the trend is to add experimental features behind user-controlled flags or preferences, and to create smaller specifications which can reach a stable state much more quickly.

My question is why p.cool-blue would not accept font-family of Nunito Sans (I’ve imported fonts and it still  takes default value of Times New Roman). Only when I input font-family in class .colors it accepts that type of font. Isn’t specificity of p.cool-blue higher than .colors. Even when I make it more specific like div.colors p.cool-blue nothing changes.
Thanks!

Are you sure you imported the font?
You should have something like this inside the head tag

<link href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans|Source+Code+Pro&display=swap"" rel=""stylesheet"">

or this at the top of your code in the css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans|Source+Code+Pro&display=swap');

Hello!
I was wondering if there is anyway to change certain properties of default bootstrap. For instance: If I have a div=“card” it always displays with a border-radius which sometimes I don’t want.
How could I change this by only using HTML and CSS? Or is the idea to just give it a second class and change this one instead? Or create another div inside the div=“card” ?
","
Change it with a custom style sheet that has the exact same selector as the Bootstrap style sheet, and that loads last so it is lowest in the cascade an can override the latter.
bootstrap.css
custom.css

Do not alter bootstrap.css. Just copy the selector and paste it into your custom.css. Keep only the properties you change.
You could also extend the selector so that it only applies to certain elements.
.special .card {
    border-radius: 0;

you can just copy paste the code? Although you might need to apply some format to make the html code show:

Hey Eric,
I am confused as to what you are trying to achieve? Is flex the way to go for with your design in mind?
Anyways a good way to understand flex-box a bit more is flexbox froggy 


flexboxfroggy.com



Flexbox Froggy
A game for learning CSS flexbox






I’m believing flexbox is a good way to go
To clarify: with the above picture I sent, the gray box on the left with the words ""UNITED STUDIOS OF SELF DEFENSE""actually extends up to the top of the viewport. if the header were removed, you’d then see the actual full height of that box. But, because the header is there, the header is in front of and covering up the full height of the flexed box. I assume its the same height with the red box with all the words in it
I don’t know how to make the box height to only go to the top of the bottom-border of the header, which is what im trying to figure out
Thanks Jannes!

Hey Eric,
Could you show me the code of the header, it may well have to do something with that. My suspicion is that you have used position fix for the header, am I correct?
In that case all you have to do really is to give the flexbox (.aboutussd) a margin-top equal to the height of the two top bars ;). This way it will push the flexbox down.
Hope this helps, if not, feel free to send me both your html and css so I can look into it ;).

Correct, for the entire header, I did use it as a fixed position
But, when I created the header, I did NOT use flexbox. the flexbox I used only for the content below the header. This site was my first time using flexbox when creating a site. ive only done tutorials with flexbox up until making this site
Coding (for me) is difficult. I have so many questions all the time

            <p>United Studios of Self Defense is the largest martial arts school in North America. Since 1968, our students have studied USSD's unique system of Kempo&ndash;style martial arts from the finest instructors in the United States. From the earliest beginnings nearly 2,000 years ago, the martial arts have been steeped in tradition. Nowhere else will you feel that sense of rich history than at a USSD studio.</p>

        <img src=""images/senseijarod.jpg"" alt=""Sensei Jarod"">
    
        <p>Sensei Jarod started training at age 8 and has loved the martial arts ever since. His first instructor, Greg Crouse, taught him the very basics of what it means to be a martial artist. Until sadly Mr. Greg Crouse was needed elsewhere in USSD. <q>I was only with Greg Crouse for a short time</q> said Sensei Jarod. His second instructor had the most influence in his time training was Brenden Turner who was the one responsible for making him grow into the instructor he is now. Further honing his understanding of the kempo system, enabling him to teach to children and adults of any, and every age. That didn't last long. Mr Turner very sadly passed away very early in his martial arts life. His third and one of his last instructor before he was sent to University City was Jonny Brookman who also had a great influence on his training and had further refined Sensei Jarod's skills in teaching as well as in the martial arts. After years of training in Shaolin Kempo Sensei Jarod thought it was time start teaching others the magic of Shaolin Kempo. Orignally from Costa Mesa (Orange County area) he has been training with some of the best instructors in United Studios of Self Defense from all over the country, and is a certified black belt instructor from the instructors academy. He has a deep understanding of Shaolin Kempo and is always willing and offering a helping hand whether in the arts or in everday life. He constantly seeks to improve not only himself but everyone around him. He knows that everyone can reach their true potential with just the right training and tools. <q>The greatest virtue is to follow nature. To see the simplicity. To realize one's true nature. To cast off selfishness. And temper desire.</q></p>

aboutussd starts at the top behind the header because it is the first element in the normal flow of the page. The header is an independent element. It’s been taken out of the flow in order to have a fixed position.
It helps me to think about the flow of a page and to position items based on the flow when working with css. The normal flow is how items are arranged to start with.  For example if you have several block elements:
<header>Header</header>
<main>Main</main>
<footer>Footer</footer>
They will line up one after the other even without anything position-related in the css.

If an element is taken out of the flow – for example, if you assign position: fixed; to header –  it becomes an independent element. It no longer lines up in the flow.

In this example, main and footer will now need to be adjusted relative to their positions in the flow.

That makes sense. I’ve since tried to “trick” my mind into thinking that everything automatically is being pulled upwards as if there’s a magnet at the top pulling on everything below it. Then, if I position an element as absolute or fixed, then that positioned element automatically is not affected by any pull at all. It instead is popped forwards towards me on its own new plane. After that, the remaining stuff “behind it” still is affected upwards by the magnet pull. This is pretty much what actually happens I know. Your explanation and visual representation were great! Thanks!

This is a perfect description of what’s happening!

232,"Percentages make sense to me for sizing, but","Get Help,CSS",,4,"
If I use %’s when setting element sizes and placement on a page, is it ok to mix and match percentages with px’s, rem’s, em’s? Or, should I stick to only one type of size measurement? I would THINK percentages make the most sense because I never know how large someone else’s viewport/screen size is that they would be viewing my created webpage on. Then if they’d resize their viewport, the sizes would scale automatically if percentages were used. Of note: I know about responsive design and that’s where to incorporate handheld screen size layouts, but, I haven’t ever coded sites with responsive. I’m not ready to tackle that just yet
","
Hey Eric,
Oof where do I begin…
The type of units you like to use for size is up to you, it totally depends on what outcome you have in mind. Mixing units is ok and often used.
Do you want text to be the leading factor in design? Do you want the viewport to be the leading factor? Do I want a mix of those two? Do I want a website to be responsive or not? Those are questions you have to ask yourself.
Viewport leading:
The types of displays which are being used (which in turns determines the viewport size) is a huge factor in your choice of units. If you know a website will always only be shown on a 1024 x 768 screen there is no need to play with percentages or other relative units.
In case that your website is viewed on different viewport sizes I advise to use relative units however the type of unit you use for each element type may have different results.
For example:
Using % for width and height is a great unit to make sure elements are sized according to the parent element. However once applied to font size this may affect its readability.
Say your browser has a standard font size of 16px which is then defined as 100%. If you have a div where you want a bigger font you will have to call for percentage higher then 100%, but the next child element inside this div will have that value’s size as its 100% default font size because the parent has a bigger font size. If that makes any sense. This may get to such an extend its quite confusing.
But subsequently using pixels for font size may give different results as well. If a screen is small in cm but actually has a big screen resolution (such as smartphones) a text might be too small to read.
To cope with these sizing issues they came up with a unit called rem which is relative to font-size of the root element. This makes sure a text is always sized according to the browsers default font size and you can assume its readable on each device.
This does not mean you can’t use rem for width and height, padding and margin. Using rem can be perfectly used if you want all those  attributes have values relative to the font size. a.k.a. Font leading.
Anyways, which type you use is entirely up to you and mixing is ok. I suggest playing with them to get a feeling for them. And don’t just limit yourself to the ones you mentioned. For a list of static and relative units please go here.
Hope this sheds some light,
Kind regards,
Jannes
PS: Also, don’t forget that a way to deal with different viewport sizes is the use of @media queries.

Your statement: “Say your browser has a standard font size of 16px which is then defined as 100%. If you have a div where you want a bigger font you will have to call for percentage higher then 100%, but the next child element inside this div will have that value’s size as its 100% default font size because the parent has a bigger font size. If that makes any sense. This may get to such an extend its quite confusing.”
That did make sense. It eventually would come to a % of a % and then a % of THAT percentage, etc. which can get confusing to code with. I’d then wind up needing to write unusual percentage sizes than I normally would BECAUSE of the parent/child/inheritance relationship. I fully understand what you mean, lol.
I think for me the use of percentages is best used on keeping the placement location of items on the page (NOT the actual words that are read or clicked upon) in consistent distance, depending on the size of a viewport. Then, the actual letters on a page would probably be best to use rem’s, as they would scale in size as the viewport is enlarged or shrunken

To see an example of how percentage can take on weird behavior, construct a nested list…
<ol>
  <li>item</li>
  <li><ol>
    <li>nested</li>
    <li><ol>
      <li>nest nested</li>
      <li>nest nested</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>nested</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>item</li>
</ol>

CSS
body {
    font-size: 100%;
}
ol {
    font-size: 85%;
}

One thing I usually don’t mess with is height unless I’m sure it will fit into the view port. It defaults to auto and stretches to fit content. If we want a fixed height, then use a fixed unit or ems that scale with the text. On the off chance text might overflow, an overflow: scroll property helps deal with that, and keeps the height fixed.
"
233,Best Box Size Practice?,"Get Help,CSS",,6,"
Is it a good practice to try to think of everything in the form of boxes? Then typically work from what would typically be the biggest box (background) to the smallest box (front/foreground)?
Example: I want the whole page to have a gray background, so BODY tag to gray, then three column layout with each column blue, so a DIV/SECTION/HEADER tag blue. Followed by paragraph background green so P tag green?
I’ve noticed I occasionally add backgrounds after I add content. I’m probably doing things in an unusual order occasionally. I know it’s not a MUST to work from back to front, I just want to confirm that it’s probably commonplace and an easier/best practice…
","



 etjdogger:

P tag green?


That will only give the actual paragraphs a background, not the margins above and below, or any white space left and right. You might find it necessary to give the P’s a container of their own and assign the background: green to it.

That I understand. What im meaning though is that it’s good practice to work from what is the LARGEST box, which is typically the background, then work to the forefront of the screen, with those being smaller boxes. I realize I can set paddings and margins. but hypothetically, if I chose NOT to set a margin or padding, then the biggest “box” is the entire body, then “section” or “div” etc, then (for example) an unordered list “ul” that happens to be in the section. in other words, WORK IN LAYERS, back to front, is what im meaning

Layers are good, especially for laying in ground rules with low specificity. The more rules you can declare in that respect, the less you end up with cluttering the more specific rule sets.
It will take some reading, but it would good to understand inheritance in terms of what can be inherited from a parent, and what cannot be. That means going through the property list and looking for that detail. Perhaps there are lists of these things,  (you’d think) but for sure it will be in the specs on W3C or MDN.
The body should not have too many actual style properties, imho. A background color of white, foreground color of black, base font size of 100% (or 1rem if the html selector has the base font at 100%); margin 0, padding 0, and that’s about it.
Plan first for a desktop version and don’t put any thought into mobile or tablet. Sketch what you expect in terms of page blocking, and give each of the main components an id. Again, the less those components have to deal with style, the better. Position and dimensions, border, margin, padding, that’s about it.
Now what you put into those component frames is the layer to begin styling. As any of this goes, the best practice aspect is more geared to coding practice, D.R.Y., etc. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to design. There are, however, ways that are easier to maintain, and others that are not. I think that is something to focus on moving forward.
I’m a big fan of traversal but we see less and less of that in lessons. It’s usually id this and class that. There are ways to keep this to a minimum if we have thought our layout through and built it up in the layers, as you suggest. If that is your idea, then I’m already your fan.

Agree with all that. Especially the body. Typically the only CSS I have in the body element is the padding and margin both set to 0. My mentioning the body was just to make my ultimate point about my using layers more understandable

TBH, the old school stuff still sticks in my craw and makes learning the newer stuff a lot harder. Oh I can follow it, but remembering it is my problem, now. We used to marvel at the stuff that could be done, and that was before CSS3. Mind, the term hack was very common in those days, as we all had them in our style sheets. Thank goodness that is not a required workaround with the new Living Standard. Only the gerries will remember most of this stuff.
When’s the last time you heard about faux columns? Doesn’t come up in CSS Grids or CSS Flexbox. It was a solution in its day, and required precision if it was going to work in an adaptive environment. Today, I doubt anybody will ever be compelled to learn that layout technique. (Not mobile friendly.)
Waxing sentimental, now. Best be off…

Imagine the day before 1280 width and only shortly after 1024 width. The majority of users had 640X800 screens and were running Windows 95 or Windows 98 (or MAC OS 8) and Internet Explorer 5 (5.2 on MAC). CSS 1.2 is the current rave, and  ECMA-262 was just taking hold.
Now imagine being stuck there in your mind. The definition of h e l l .

Hey Eric,
If you want text over an image there are two approaches, either use a background image to a div with a text or place a text box over an image and position them using css modifiers.
Darkening an image directly placed in the HTML can be done using filter: brightness(value); for more info check link below. However this does not work for background images. But there is a trick you can use for this ;). You can place a linear gradient with transparency value over a background image like so:
background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.5), rgba(0,0,0,0.5)), url(images/background.jpg);

So you first state a linear gradient then put a , and call for the url.
More info on filter: brightness(value);



MDN Web Docs



brightness()
The brightness() CSS function applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear brighter or darker. Its result is a filter-function.

236,Need help Html/CSS,"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
Hi people,
I`m currently working on creating a website with HTML & CSS.
The intention is that an image will come as the entire background.
The image does contain text, but here something needs to be added.
When I add the text, it is displayed correctly on the computer. If I open it on a mobile or I resize the browser the text jumps (h2 in html). I’ve been doing this for a long time !
The text must be placed between 2 lines of text that are standard on the image.
I want this to work for all resolutions. Is that possible at all?
Do you have any tips on how to properly secure the text?
Hereby my code:

Hey @adriang001,
Let us look into this. The first thing I notice is that your code is full of syntax errors. Also I noticed css rules that contradict each other.
font weight should be font-weigth , you seem to be missing the - at multiple lines of code.
Also hex colours should be written without the space between the # and 6 digits.
You seem to be having a space between translate and its parameters:
transform: translate (-50%, -50%);

should be
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

margin: 0 car;  should be margin: 0 auto;
Example of contradicting css rules is in the body, where you first state the width to be 100% and then later you say its 1000px wide and 1000px high. With the overflow being hidden, the body will be clipped upon making the browser smaller.
With these mistakes out of the way, go check your code again and see if the website runs as intended.
Kind regards,
Jannes

237,What can override !important?,"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-setup-selectors/exercises/important?
The title says it all.
The article suggests that “once !important  is used, it is very hard to override.”
So how can you override it?
","
We might be able to bump up the specificity, but that will take some experimenting.
<p style=""font-variant: small-caps"">A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>

The style rule is near the bottom of the cascade. The only feasible way to override it is with !important on a P rule.
In the cascade, we can easily override the important rule by writing a new rule on the same selector, just further down. However, the style attribute comes back into play. It’s that rule we are trying to override.

Hi all,
I’m currently doing https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-typography/exercises/linking-fonts-ii?action=resume_content_item and I could not figure out why I was doing what the tutorial was telling me, but it would not recognize my link for step 1 of the instructions as the correct answer.
In the Google Fonts page I copied the following details:
<link href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono:400,700&display=swap"" rel=""stylesheet"">

I kept getting the error message that I was wrong, so I read back through the details and the examples and saw that the text I was copying was different to the examples. In the text I was copying it included &display=swap
I’ve removed this &display=swap and now my result is accepted as being correct. So my question is, what does this &display=swap do exactly?
Thanks!

Do you create a CSS during HTML coding or after?  Which would be more beneficial?

The structure always comes first. Work with the raw HTML then add style and presentation. It’s not important how the page looks when we are defining structure. Write the HTML, validate it and make sure everything is in place. Then work at getting the appearance to what you want.

Thanks! That’s what I was thinking but needed to be sure.

Hi everyone!
I don’t know where to ask but I give a try here…
so I have completed HTML and started the CSS course.
My issue is the following.
How do I know what Im styling in CSS? I know it is a stupid question; but looking at these codes just does not make sense for me which part Im styling in HTML (there, it made sense for me)
From HTML, I understand the meaning of “p”, “h1”, “title” but i still miss the context of the whole code so Im very confused.
Thank for your help
p {
font-family: Arial;
}
h1 {
color: maroon;
}
.title {
color: teal;
}

In the above, p refers to all elements in the document with a P tag. h1 refers to all those with an H1 tag. .title refers only to those elements sporting a title class attribute.

Thank you!
What happen if a blog, text has similar codes and not only one from the following like h1, title ect. then how do you which one you just edited?
Thank you.
Sorry a bit complicated for me (yet)

243,Writing a selector that applies a font-family attribute to all text at once,"Get Help,CSS",,6,"
I am currently doing one of the basic CSS projects on Codeacademy, Healthy Recipes.
One of the steps in the project was:
Finally, let’s make the font Helvetica instead of the default Times New Roman.
Instead of writing multiple selectors to apply the  font-family  property,
write a selector that applies a  font-family  attribute to all text at once.
The selector should target the  h1 ,  h2 ,  p , and  li  elements.
Here is my question:
Is it wrong to choose ‘body’ selector to change all text at once?
What is the standard selector to use in this situation?
","



 kevindclee:

Is it wrong to choose ‘body’ selector to change all text at once?


No, that would be the simplest approach, and the least specific.
body { font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; }

This is what is referred to as the base font. Similarily we can set othe base (default) values for things like color, background, and size.
body {
    font-size: 100%;
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    color: black;
    background: white;
}

Note that the 100% means we accept the user set font-size that their machine is configured to. If they are used to large font, then they may have the default set to 32px. Our page would make this the value corresponding to 1em or 1rem.

Thank you for your reply!
I am new to CSS so I have a few questions about your reply,

I learned that html will choose Times New Roman as its font if it is not specified,
but why use Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif as base font?
What does this code do? Does it set font to Helvetica? Arial? sans-serif? or just picks randomly out of the three?

font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

Thank you!




 kevindclee:

why use Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif as base font?


If we don’t wish to change the base font, then why are we having this discussion? The choice of base font has fallen to us. Why any font family? Because we are setting the base. What we choose as that base is our choice, according to our design parameters. I used “Helvetica” for Apple devices, “Arial” for Windows devices, and sans-serif as the default for all other devices that don’t recognize either. This is the standard way of writing for browser compatibility.
The order is important. Start with the font that is least likely to be supported, and go from there to the next… and down to the one that all will support, sans-serif, given that these fonts are members of that generic font family.

I am so far removed from setting anything on my computer that it’s all an uncertainty for me, but, the typical system should allow the user to set which font to assign as the default generic font-family.
serif: ""Times New Roman"", ""Times""
sans-serif: ""Arial"", ""Helvetica""
mono-space: ""Courier New""
cursive: ""Comic Sans MS"",
fantasy: ""[Fantasy](https://www.linotype.com/1499797/fantasy-family.html)""

When we write the generic family at the end of our chosen fonts list, it will come from that list.

I have learned so much from your replies.
Thank you!!

Very useful and informative article, I also learned a lot of new things for myself. Thank you for sharing this information. Programming is probably the only thing that I manage to write. Because at the university I always had difficulties with writing essays and various research papers, for this I always needed help. And if I hadn’t found in time https://ca.edubirdie.com/research-paper-help, I don’t know how I would write all these works on my own. But with programming I have a lot better since it’s interesting to me and I’m happy to try to figure it out and maybe, if I put in a lot of effort, I’ll be a good specialist.

I’m trying to do that challenge project, and I did I think a good enough sample of the color aspect, but when I went to put down the font, for some reason it ignored my .color div block and all the div blocks inside the .color div block. As seen in the picture. It looks like my .color div only has the heading inside it even though everything is supposed to be inside it.

Hi,
In the (linked) project, Task 2 is to change the width of the  so that it stretches across its entire parent element. I used display: block but that didn’t work. Why is that so? I thought block is supposed to make an element fill the entire width of the page?
Thank you so much in advance!

 kokoleka:

No this is not the case. Using display:block; makes sure the elements display one after the other.
Here is some documentation on this.
Task 2 says btw that you should change the width of the element.
Hope it helps. Good luck.

Hi, thanks for the response. From what I read from the documentation, it does seem to indicate that displaying items as block makes them flow in the next line.
Actually I was referring to the lesson on Display:Block in my post.
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-display-positioning/exercises/display-block?action=resume_content_item
where it says that block-level elements fill the entire width of the page.
My interpretation of Task 2 was to work the css such that the resulting width of the element stretches across the entire parent by any method that works, ie it doesn’t have to be literally using the width property to do it 
So my real question is, why didn’t display: block provide the same result ?

Hey @beta5061350787
Welcome to the forums! Sorry you’re having trouble with the environment!
If you’re stuck in a particular lesson and can’t advance with the “Next” button, it’s likely because of one of two things:

You’ve not completed the requirements for the current exercise, or
The environment is having a wobble and it’s got stuck.

If you’ve definitely done everything the exercise was asking you to do, but you just can’t click the Next  button to advance, try coming out of the lesson and back to the course page and then go back into the lesson. This usually sorts the environment out when it gets stuck. 
Let us know whether that sorts out your problem. 

Thank you very much

If the web browser isn’t working, there may be something stopping it from loading. I’d try the obvious stuff first like clearing your browser cache and see if that makes any difference. 

If you’re still having trouble, and haven’t already looked at this: Troubleshooting Guide, it might be worth a try. Good luck!

IF you have the option for another browser, sometimes that works too.

Yep, another good troubleshooting step.

","
I don’t believe you can change the color of the pattern itself with CSS. You could use z-index to place an element over the entire image like a simple <div></div>, give the element a color of White or maybe LightGray and then use the opacity of the <div></div> to make the background appear lighter. Start with opacity: 0.09 or so. Just an idea. Good luck!

What´s a OP?


Opening Post, the object, or the member, Original Poster.

what else do you need to help me?

A set of screen shots at various widths, and a description of what you expect to happen, as opposed to what is actually happening.

So the first and fourth image is of the desktop version
And the second and third is of 1024 px (with media query)
what i tried to do is create another media query for 470px and it isnt working and you can see my attempt in the code posted previously

yes,  I am the OP
do you have an idea of whats going on?

Not entirely, no. Still trying to piece my way through it. It would be nice to see a set of selectors that occur in all three states, and have unique values in each. It would also be nice to see more of a float behavior for narrow screens so there is a single column.

.banner-content h2
.banner-content h1

in an effort to fix it i tried to make it less specific and left it as h1 and h2

those two are just some

Below 1024 the menu disappears. Are you planning to put a hamburger there?
Would Flex of Grids help you out of this dilemna?

well the menu is supposed to disappear and turn into the word menu, whats a hamburger?
and the problem i have is that the media query that i creted isnt ‘activating’ when the screen is 470 px or below, its in the code above
@media only screen and (max-width: 470px){
  .banner-content h2{
    font-size: 0.77rem;
  }

  .banner-content h1{
    font-size: 1rem;
  }

  .banner-content{
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
    top: 10rem;
  }

  .banner{
    height: 15rem;
  }
}


*created (correction)

Not to point anything out, specifically, but consider of list of properties, A, B, C, that will all have their own rule in each state. Consider the desktop state as the default, but do not dedicate any HTML to just that state. In other words, no .desktop class. The default state is the desktop without giving it a special class.
Construct the page exactly how you want it to appear on the desktop (> 1024). Scale it for the tablet (480 ~ 1024),  and scale it for the smart phone (< 480).
Granted some things are not going to change regardless the screen, so obviously the default style rules will always apply across the board.
A default
B tablet
C phone

The selector rules in the media queries will override those in the default style sheet. Use the same selectors for this purpose.
Be sure that for narrow screens it is reduced to one column. No splits on the screen. The user will happily scroll as opposed to looking at smaller images.

Instructions

Secret Agent Supply
Using the tools on your personal computer, you’ll build a responsive website for Secret Agent Supply Inc., the world’s leader in secret agent tech.
In this project, you will build a full desktop website, then you’ll use your knowledge of responsive web design to make the Secret Agent Supply’s website look great on any device.
In addition to the step-by-step instructions below, we will provide the necessary images and colors to complete the website.
The solution to this project is displayed to the right. Use this as a reference along the way. Mark the tasks below as complete when you finish them. This will ensure you are staying on track.
If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “ Get Help “ to see a  project walkthrough video .
Tasks
7/8Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off




Open your file manager and create a new folder called  SecretAgentSupply . Inside of this folder, create the following items:

A file named  index.html .
A folder named  resources .

Inside of the  resources  folder, create the following:

A folder named  css  with a  style.css file, and a  reset.css  file inside. The  reset.css  file should contain thiscode.





Open  index.html  in a text editor and add the boilerplate HTML.
Title the page  Secret Agent Supply Inc. .
Also, link  resources/css/style.css  and  resources/css/reset.css  in the  <head> section of  index.html .
In addition, you’ll need the following images to complete the web page:

Logo image
Main banner background image
Pen image
Watch image
Glasses image





Click here to look at the finished page design. Using the finished design, create the HTML structure, including the logo, main banner, navigation, product grid, location, hours, and footer in  index.html .




Nice work! At this point, you should have the page’s HTML written.
Begin writing the CSS to make the page match the desktop view of the page.
For reference, click here to see a design spec of the website’s design. Design specs outline important design specifications to help you replicate the design in HTML and CSS.




Great! Now you should have a good looking desktop site.
Now, resize the page to different widths, from large to small. You may notice the page breaks, or does not appear correctly when viewed on smaller screens.
Write a media query that targets a screen width less than 1024 pixels. 1024 pixels is near the size of a tablet in the portrait orientation.




Inside of the 1024 pixels media query, make changes so that the site appears as in the tablet design here. You can find the design spec here.
The changes include:

Changing the font sizes in the main banner.
Making the navigation display a “Menu” button instead of all the menu options.
Making only two products appear, both taking approximately half the screen’s width.





Resize your browser to an even smaller width, to simulate a phone’s screen.
Write a media query that targets screens with a width less than 470 pixels.




Refer to the mobile design here and the corresponding design spec here. Use these resources to write CSS that makes the page consistent with the phone-sized designs.
The changes include:

Making the headline appear at the bottom of the banner and take up the width of the screen.
Changing the banner’s font size to match the design.
In the product section, making only one product visible. It should take up 90% of the width of the screen.
Making the “Location” and “Hours” elements stack on top of each other.
The footer’s text should be centered in the screen.

Resize your page and make sure that the appearance of the page changes in response to the screen’s width.
Congratulations! You just built a responsive website that looks great no matter what device it’s viewed on.

Like this?
If yes, in this case, you could simply use a text-align: center on header, then some padding-top to move everything down a bit.

Yours IS how I want it to look. i was able to move and center it. But EVERYTHING moved down: The h1 My Martial Arts Journey and the logo. the logo is now hanging out of the header on the bottom. I did mess with the code alot in other ways before i made this reply. I’m trying. here is my new CSS:
header {
    background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, #000000, #444);
    border-bottom: 4px solid #f00000;
    text-align: center;
    padding-top: 75px;
    height: 160px;
    width: 100%;
}

h1 {
    color: #f00000;
    font-size: 2em;
    text-align: center;
    padding-top: 22px;
    position: absolute;
    margin-left: 750px;
}

.logo {
    float: left;
    padding-top: 22px;
    padding-left: 10px;
}





 etjdogger:

position: absolute; margin-left: 750px;


remove this and it will be perfect
You don’t need the margin left because you aligned your text, and the position is messing up the order

i commented that out and it just moved everything down a little bit

Currently your nav links are not centered because of the logo being there. do you want your nav center and the logo where exactly ?

h1 centered towards top of header
nav centered apx 25 pixels below towards bottom of header below the h1
logo apx 15 pixels on the FAR LEFT of the entire header

I think it would be best is to divide your content into two for the two sections and put in divs and align them side by side.
like so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5645986/two-column-div-layout-with-fluid-left-and-fixed-right-column


Screenshot (121).png1900×975 28.6 KB

.logo {
	text-align:left;
	margin-top: -122px;
}

Not the best practice and won’t work with mobile but this can be done.

add a padding bottom to h1, sorry didn’t add in and take a screenshot

I don’t get it. All this CSS crap does is get me frustrated

theres too many ways to do one thing and im lost

When it comes to markup and CSS there is always a way out, or rather, a way to do something. Never doubt that. What is it you wish to do?

Trying to get it to look very close to what zainabrawat has a few posts above. in that layout, he/she has the logo where i want it. the ""Mt Martial Arts Journey i want more towards the top of the header. the nav raised about 15 pixels higher, and more space between the h1 and nav. Ugh, its frustrating me. the layout you see there is more-less how i want it, but, just a bit more precise in the layout

https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
should help

Thank You, for the great article.

Taken from the article, this is the one I used for years, long before flex or grid. The line cannot wrap or it queers up the effect immensely, hence the nowrap. If one is working with hard code and you know it won’t wrap, then the white-space rule is not needed.
.center-text-trick {
  height: 100px;
  line-height: 100px;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

Given that adaptive approaches in sizing lighten the load for responsive design, part of that is proportion. In the above I would not use fixed dimensions but rather relative dimensions, either to html (rem) or the parent element (em or %).
For instance, given that the document accepts user settings for base font size,
html, body {
    font-size: 100%;
}

we may stipulate to a font-size globally of 1rem unless altered by the parent. A parent might stipulate to a font-size of 1em, which would then scale as the parent scales.
So now we can use em in our declaration, to an approximate match with 100px…
height: 6em;
line-height: 6em;

If we need to dial in the precision, we could use 6.25em.
Eg.
1em ~ 16px

100 / 16 => 6.25

Once we get the hang of proportional sizing, we never go back to px. It’s a solid no-brainer approach to adaptive sizing and fits right into the responsive model.

254,Background Header Color Height,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
I’m trying to figure out WHAT ELEMENT I need to style so im able to set the height of the background color in the header. I want a black background in the header. These are the elements within the header:

an h1
a nav with 7 a href links
an img

Of note:

I have set the image to position: absolute. I also want apx 15px above and below of the image
I floated the img left already

Again, of those three elements, which one do I choose to use in CSS to style so I can create the height of my black background?
Thanks in advance!!!
","
Are the elements you mention contained in a <header></header>? If so, you should be able to set the background-color of the <header></header> element to black. You’ll have to give the header a height property as well.
header {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: black;
}

Hope this helps!

Yes! that did work. Thanks!
I almost always struggle to figure out how many levels of nestings I need to type in css to style an element. and the nav can be a nightmare for me because theres always at least three elements creating the nav. but, yes, your reply did work!

255,How to set a color overlay on a background image,"Get Help,CSS",,1,"
Hello, sorry if this question is stupid.
So I just finished the Tea Cozy exercise, and I decided to play around with it a little more, styling random stuff. But I kind of got stuck on a very simple thing.
Let’s say I want a color overlay on the background image of my banner, or, conversely, I want to set an opacity for my background image so that it shows a color underneath, how do I do that in the cleanest way possible?
I’ve looked around but all the methods I found were a little trickier (nested divs or box-shadows, mostly) and even though they seem reasonable I was wondering if there is a proper way to do this, a simple clean solution.
Event though I usually find a way to ‘make it work’ I often fear I’m overcomplicating things and I don’t want to pick up bad habits, so any help on th is would be much appreciated!
Thanks in advance

256,Correct size of pictures for mobile and desktop,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
Hello everyone!
I’m wondering what are the correct sizes for pictures on the web.
As far as I know,
-mobiles: pictures should have at least the width of the viewport but more is better otherwise users can’t zoom in.
How many pixels more?
-desktop: if you want to use a picture full screen, things are as said before.
For smaller pictures: at least 1200-1600 px at 72 ppi (?)
But what about HD screens???
Should I choose different picture’s size for them? I guess so. Then I’ll need to check what are the sizes of most popular HD screens?
I think I got confused because of the difference between viewports’s sizes and screens’s definition (I’m not talking about screen’s resolution obviously).
Can anyone be so kind to cast a light on this topic?
Thank you very much!!! 
","
Interesting question.
For the precise size of a image there are no specific rules other than: “If its slow its probably to big.”
I think the ideal solution would be to save the image 3 times.

1st will be the original.
2nd will be the copy used for the website. This one will probably be smaller in size than the original.
3rd will be a copy used for mobile. This one will be even smaller than the second one in size.

This is afcourse not lmited to three images. You could for example add a thumbnail if this is needed.
You could create a function that creates these extra copies on uploading the image.
You could also use for example cloudinary as an image host which has these functionality already.
Some more information on this is found here.
Hope its helpful.

Hi @biirra and thank you so much for your answer! It is useful. 
And… Wow! That cloudinary looks fantastic! Probably it’s even too much at the moment, but I’m glad you pointed it out.
Thank you!

hi there i don’t uderstand what means this code in css "" .share a:hover"" what’s hover please someone can hel me

Doing a quick google search will give you the answer on that:



MDN Web Docs



:hover
The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).





The example in the link is quite helpful as well.

Be sure to check out @greentreemee’s answer too!

Hi @amadoudjoulde,
Just adding more to @codinghawk Answer.
There are 2 pseudo things in CSS -
Pseudo Classes : Pseudo Classes allows us to style a special state of an element - hover, active. hover is a class that targets special state of link “hover” and applies styles when it happens

a:hover {
  background-color: green;
}

Pseudo Elements: Pseudo Elements helps us to find specific part of an Element and style it.
p::first-letter {
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
}



From a specificity point of view, pseudo elements have the same specificity as element types; pseudo classes have the same specificity as classes.
style  id   class  type
  0     0     0     1     =>  ELEMENT TYPE
style  id   class  type
  0     0     1     0     =>  CLASS

258,When is the right time to learn css?,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
Hello! I would need an advice. When is the right time to learn css, after mastering html or is better to learn both simultaneous? Thanks!
","
Hi, and welcome to the forums.
When working with HTML, chances are that you will get into contact with CSS eventually too.
I feel like learning them together is better, however I would say that knowing the basics of HTML first could make it a bit easier.


Tree Analogy:
You can think about HTML and CSS as a tree.
HTML acts like the tree itself, its branches for example.
CSS is the leaves and flowers that make it look better/ more appealing.
Without the leaves a tree can still stand, but without the tree, the leaves will just fall to the ground.


It makes perfect sense. Thank you!
One more question, if I may? I havr reached to 50% of css course but i feel like i am allready forgetting some of the lessons. I believe it is better to practice after every 2 or 3 chapters. Am I rght?

Practicing does help a lot.
You can also create your own test website on your local machine to make it a bit easier.
Have a look at: How to Create your own HTML files.
You don’t have to practice every chapter, but you can if you want to.
Understanding how things work, makes it easier to remember, and even if you forget something after you understand it, you will most probably remember again after a quick internet search on how it works.
Also remember, you can always go back to courses you have already completed and read through them again.

i have made some small super basic projects using VS CODE. Thanks a lot for the replies!

259,Flexbox ToDo App: Simplified nesting & more semantic markup?,"Get Help,CSS",,1,"
I’ve just completed the section on Flexbox in the Web Development track, and ran through the tasks to correct the layout issues in the ToDo App exercise.
Unsure how much I am doing the right thing here, but I felt two things were occurring during the Nesting Flexboxes section, and in this exercise:

Too much usage of div elements in order to achieve the structure required for the flexboxes
I’m not sure if it is ‘advised’ somewhere to be using divs for each element of flexboxes (?), but it doesn’t make for very semantic HTML. It’s hard to read and may have other downsides, too?
So I ‘improved’ the code for this exercise, and have removed the divs around the h3 and p elements which represent the ‘day’ and ‘task’ boxes; instead moving the associated classes where we place the flexbox declarations directly into the h3 and p tags; and making sure that there are 3 p tags for each day.

Too much nesting of flexboxes in order to achieve the required result
Further, I made changes to the css such that each task is no longer a flexbox container; I couldn’t see any need for them to be set as containers? These are the lowest-level elements of the nesting, which we need to control using wrapping and justifying, but we set that at the level above (divs wth the row class).

In simple terms, in the exercise we had this nesting structure (all child containers are also items, but I’m identifying here where we specifically are using container and item class declarations):
|-container (flex container)
||»–week (flex container and flex item)
|||—row (flex container)
||||»–square (flex container and flex item)
||»–reminder (flex container and flex item)
In my revised code, we have this nesting structure (and specific usage of flex css declarations):
|-container (flex container)
||»–week (flex container and flex item)
|||—row (flex container)
|||»—square (flex item)
|»—reminder (flex item)
So with this code, we’re one container down in the main nesting, and another for reminder (this bit is debatable but the intended structure for this section in the code is unclear, so I have removed the container).
You can see my code and what looks to still be the correct result, in this jsfiddle.

In essence, my questions are:


Why, in the exercises and projects, are flexboxes implemented with so many divs (we’re taught IIRC in the HTML course that too many divs isn’t a good structure?).


Why in this exercise did we give the square class display: flex… which turns each and every task box (item) into a container?

262,The CSS quiz on advanced grids got me confused,"Get Help,CSS",,6,"
Hi guys.
I was wondering if someone could explain this to me (see picture attachment). In words:
Two seemingly identical questions with identical example code, with the only difference being asking for the width or the height of the “5th box” - if it were to be added. In one instance the right answer lies within the predefined height of IMPLICITLY added rows (grid-auto-rows), in the other instance, the right answer lies within the predifined EXPLICITLY defined columns (grid-template-columns). There are nothing that seperate the way these questions are asked, which leads me to believe one would go about answering them both in the same way / based on the same theory. But alas. In one case, you’ll be correct to assume that the 5th box is implicitly added, while in the other - explicitly added. How come?
If you were to take one of these seemingly identical questions and then learn from what the right answer is, then you’d get the other one wrong. Is there something I have missed (perhaps something something about something being whatever as default), or is this just a minor mistake by the quiz-maker?   and if so! - which question/answer should I draw knowledge from?

When an html element is added, and the predefined grid (in this case 2 rows and 2 columns) can’t contain it, the grid implicitly adds a new row which receives the grid-auto-rows value for it’s height. In the second question the 5th element is still added to an implicitly added new row, but into the original explicitly defined 1st column, so it gets the width of the grid-template-columns. If, we added grid-auto-flow: column; to the css, the grid would implicitly add a new column instead of a new row for the 5th element. In that case the 5th element would have the predefined height of the explicitly created row, but the width of the implicitly created new column as defined by grid-auto-columns. Hopefully that made some sense. 

Hi, thanks for the reply, and sorry I’m late to reply back here.
But wait wait wait… I think I’m picking up on it (though I have read your answer 5 times and not sure how to read it all): Can the fifth element (any extra element that doesn’t fit the grid template) only be either a row, or a column? I mean, in many ways, that’s of course very logical - but I have been thinking the fifth element can sort of be both (I might have been fooled by the fact there was values for both auto-rows and auto-columns). And as you say, the property “grid-auto-flow: columns” is used for when you want that extra element to be counted as a column, and not a row - which is the default? And this is why the “grid-auto-row”- property containts the right answer in the first question, because the height is defined by the values of rows, while the question for width in the second in is defined by the values for columns - but the fifth element is still counted as a row when implicitly added, which means I must ignore the value for “grid-auto-column” in order to find the width - and instead look to “grid-template-columns”?
Did I get it??

Yes. That’s essentially it. You start in their example with a 2x2 grid, so it will only contain up to 4 elements. When the 5th is added the default for grid-auto-flow: is row, so a row is added. If you add grid-auto-flow: column to the css, a column would be added instead. New rows would get the height of grid-auto-rows, but inherit the width of the already existing columns.  New columns get the width of grid-auto-columns, but inherit the height of the already existing rows.

Sweet! Thanks a bunch  That one was really bugging me.

How can I calculate this?


There are three inner divs, each 100px wide. The parent container is 390px wide.
On the assumption that space around each div is equivalent on all four sides, that means,
3 * 100   => 300
390 - 300 =>  90    // space to be divided evenly
3 * 2     =>   6    // number of even divisions
90 / 6    =>  15    // space in front of first div




 taisalvarez:

How many extra pixels will element #alpha have?


When we add up the flex-grow values on all three elements we get, 6. That means #alpha will get 2 / 6 of the change, or 1/3 of 60px => 20px.



 taisalvarez:

space-between;


Here we might assume there is no leading or trailing space, so,
3 * 50     => 150
300 - 150  => 150
150 / 2    => 75px   // space between

This all needs to be verified since I’m not looking at the lesson on Flex.

CSS Grid Layout percentage didn't work well CSS


    Hi, I’ve just found some problems with my CSS grid project: pup spa. 
Unlike the video, my grid which had a value of percentage didn’t work well. 
And I’ve found this update: Update behavior of CSS Grid Layout percentage row tracks and gutters(https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6708326821789696) 
Because of that update, my gird didn’t work. What should I do solve this problem? 
I think specifying the intrinsic height and width is the solution for this. Is it right? 
Then, How can I set up this…

Dumb question… Do you have a complete HTML document, meaning doctype, html element, head element, in addition to what we see above?
Assuming you do, your link element looks correct so the only question that comes to mind is, where is the style.css file relative to the index.html file? Are they both in the same directory?

I didn’t select the entire html file whoops. No worries its there.
They are both in the same directory, or at least I think.





For clarity, rename your html file to index.html.
That is the name used on files that act as the home page of a directory. Consider a live site URL…
https://www.example.com/index.html

The reason we can access this page with only the domain is because the server looks for index.html.
https://www.example.com/

is effectively the same URL.

Wait so how does index.html have to do anything with .css, and im not quite necessarily looking to create a domain yet. And what do you mean by style.css file relative to the index.html file, or do you just mean that are they in the same directory?

The whole talk about index.html being a thing is because it is a thing. Even in your project folders, practice using that name if it is the home page of the project. Give the proper name to the folder.
widget/
+ css/
+ js/
+ images/
- index.html

Now the name is the URL.
https://www.example.com/widget/

and index.html will be sent back to the client.
+ means folder, - means file.
If the concerns are to be separate, then it makes sense to have them in their own folders. Style concerns (skin, position, &c.) go in the css folder. Script concerns (DOM, interaction, AJAX, &c.) go in the js folder. Media will go into its foray of folders.
Set up your local projects like this and it is easy to upload whole directories to a host server. The only difference might be how absolute the paths are on the server based pages. I typically write URLs as / to mean site root, so, /css/ means the css folder on the site root.
We are not doing this on our computer since our files are generally in a user account documents folder. / in that environment means, C:\, namely the root of the local volume.
Within a folder we can use relative paths.
css/style.css

js/script.js

images/pic.png

all those URLs will work on your computer AND on the server.

Do you mean this:





Yes. Create a template of that folder with a basic HTML page and basic stylesheet in the css folder and you can start new projects on a dime. Copy the folder, paste it with a new name, and you have self-contained site folder.
Eventually you will have site, and that will change a lot of things. This general structure of our developmental behavior and thinkig will gel and become one’s own way to compartmentalize projects in one’s own mind so they don’t collide with one another. This is no easy task. Your training starts in how you manage your projects. Simple, practical, portable, re-usable. That is my bottom line on core resources.

Finally, only a day after I started to learn how to do html, it worked. Now I just gotta properly divide my site up, and make the home, and about links. But that’s for tomorrow.

266,CSS Grid : row below where it should be?,"Get Help,CSS",,10,"
Sorry for the bother, I have been trying to apply my (very recent) knowledge of HTML and CSS to build a “dummy website” of a webcomic I’m planning.
Well anyways, here is my question :
I created a (really simple) grid for the character page, here is what it looks like (it looks quite ugly right now, because I figured it would be better to format everything on a separate stylesheet that I could use for other pages, not only the characters one, so right now there is only the layout of the page on this stylesheet.

display: grid;
grid-template-rows: 250px 50px 80px repeat(13,250px) 200px;
grid-template-columns: 500px 500px;
justify-content : center;
}

.header {

.menu li {

}

.h1 {
grid-row: 1 /span 2;

Now for some reason I don’t understand, .portrait naturally begins at row 4, while .description begins at row 5 and I don’t know why.
I corrected it using
.lexus {
grid-row-start:4;
}

but I suspect I missed an important rule of CSS grid because I don’t know why they would begin at different rows.

Hi, do you mind posting your HTML code, too?
That way I could rebuild it for trial + error debugging, right now it’s a bit hard to follow, at least for me.

aah yes, sorry. I’m editing it in the first post right now.

Alright, first tip after having a quick look at your HTML:
class=classname is not something you should make a habit of (<div class=footer>).
use class=""classname"" instead. Same pattern for href and src, the "" "" are important.
Second tip, you’ve got inline style attributes like width in HTML, since you’re using CSS, you might want to shift them over to it - unless there’s an important reason for it to be there instead.
Putting class=“class name” like so, without a - between actually creates separate classes, one for class and one for name instead of one class for class-name, not sure if that’s intended.

Thanks for the feedback. The class=footer is a mistake. Infortunately I am a very typo-prone person.
For the width : it’s a good question to say the truth. Right now I’m just messing with things, but that image is probably not the only one ending up in the header. (Truth is, I’m still building content, and since my computer is very old, it’s a nightmare just opening photoshop to actually make the digital art I want to add). I felt that resizing the image in the HTML would be faster than multiplying classes to include it in the CSS, but perhaps it’s not how it’s done ? or I’m not foreseeing some problem with changing image size directly in the HTML ?
And for the class with two names yes, it was intended. I saw it randomly on a source code and figured it would help me make changes of both portrait and description of a single character in one go.




 bespectacledpenguin:

or I’m not foreseeing some problem with changing image size directly in the HTML ?


Having HTML and CSS separated makes it easier to maintain, scale and implement changes. It’s good practice in general, and then there is specificity.
quoting @mtf Roy here (from another thread)

Specificity if something we should keep a tight rein on, keeping our document’s specificity as low as possible so that future changes to the page or site in general are not a massive undertaking, but a smooth transition.

Higher specificity as we go left. The term priority is not really a common term in CSS. Specificity is an indication of importance of a selector.




 bespectacledpenguin:

And for the class with two names yes, it was intended. I saw it randomly on a source code and figured it would help me make changes of both portrait and description of a single character in one go.


There’s the explanation for the error, both elements are class portrait and get assigned the same space of the page, that’s what is causing the error. Edit: the column can be the same for the .portrait class, but the row never gets assigned. Unless you assign it as you did with



 bespectacledpenguin:

.lexus { grid-row-start:4; }


So that was less of a fix and more of a necessary piece of information for your page to display the way you want it to.

Just to make sure, you wanted the names to be in the left column and the descriptions in the right column, right?
I figured that because you made 13 copies of these lines leading me to assume there’s more “characters” to come.

So the aim was :
Row 3
[TITLE <h1> (here “Special Ops Squad”)] on 2 columns
Row fourth to 13 (although most of these will be hidden at first, I’ll unhide them when they actually appear in the comic)
[Portait Character 1 (where I will insert an image)][Description character 1 (with name <h2> and short description in <p>]
… and so forth. I only began with the data for 2 char first so that I could test it out
So the layout above is correct. I just wanted to know why I had to tell the “description” column to begin at row 4 but not the “portrait” column.
At first I made the mistake of adding “grid-row-start : 4” to .portrait and .desc. which obviously resulted in all my rows squashing together on row 4. When I removed the initialization of rows alltogether, it resulted in

image.png1068×750 16.7 KB

which I fixed with with the
.lexus {grid-row-start:4;}

but out of curiosity I wanted to know why, even though .portrait and .desc were both initialized simply by specifying columns and not rows and both (row 4, col 1) and (row 4, col 2) are free, they did not begin “naturally” both on row 4.

For your HTMl you’re thinking left, left, right, right:
    <div class=""portrait lexus""></div>   //<-- left column
    <div class=""portrait eurelia""></div> //<-- left column

    <div class=""desc lexus""></div>       //<-- right column
    <div class= ""desc eurelia""></div>    //<-- right column

While your HTML actually thinks left, right, left, right:
    <div class=""portrait lexus""></div>   //<-- left column
    <div class=""portrait eurelia""></div> //<-- right column

    <div class=""desc lexus""></div>       //<-- left column
    <div class= ""desc eurelia""></div>    //<-- right column

because it’s thinking in blocks.
You want the left and the right column from the HTML its perspective to both be on the left side.
That’s what you can achieve with the CSS row assignment.
If you simply were to put it like this on the HTML side instead, however:
    <div class=""portrait lexus""></div>   //<-- left column
    <div class=""desc lexus""></div>       //<-- right column

    <div class=""portrait eurelia""></div> //<-- left column
    <div class= ""desc eurelia""></div>    //<-- right column

There would be no need to fix it with CSS, it would just fall into place the way you want it to following the flow of HTML: top to bottom, instead of making it jump back and forth.
Here’s the order of your HTML elements for both variants, excluding the CSS.
(Think blocks from top to bottom in the HTML code.)

html_flow.jpg510×681 62.3 KB

I hope this makes sense, I find it hard to explain, since I’m lacking the proper vocabulary.
Edit: I realized it was probably a wrong picture for an example, fixed that now

No thank you, I understood it perfectly ! I chose this layout in HTML for simplicity, but it may be more efficient to change it, especially if I go around adding all my minor characters as well! . That actually would also be better if I want to hide content too, since I will be hiding a complete row…
Thank you for your help ! I’m classifying this as closed, but I’m afraid I’ll post again (I hope not too soon !)

Hello!
It appears you have an extra curly brace in your css at the end of the .error selector:
.error {
    background-color: rgba(219, 54, 24, 0.8);
}
}

That extra closing curly brace immediately precedes your footer selector. Hope this helps! 

Thank you for your reply!
I fixed the bug but it didn’t work.
The footer’s background is still white instead of grey. 
The strange thing is that it’s ok on my computer. It changed when I uploaded the files, but I didn’t make any changes to them.

I just now followed your link to your webpage, and the footer is grey. I’ve opened it with Edge, Chrome and Firefox. Are you still having problems?

Yes. I just checked again to be sure. If you follow the link, you’ll see that the footer is white but there isn’t that extra curly brace in the css file.  

Weird, it’s grey for me, too.
Back when I was styling our webshop I was going crazy with the CSS changes not displaying, until I found out I had to use a different kind of page reload that forces a CSS reload (which otherwise just uses the cached CSS), in chrome its ctrl + shift + R or shift + F5
Sometimes the code shown in the inspect window is the autocorrected code -  many browsers ignore some minor errors and just correct them somehow, so not seeing the excess curly brace might be a result of that maybe?

@coderighton it worked! Thank you! 
@trevorhodges why should rgb values would work?

rgb values are just the alternative way that I find to fail less because you just get red, green, and blue mixed into that color.




 coderighton:

which otherwise just uses the cached CSS


Funny, because any document on the server that does not match the cached version gets downloaded and replaces it. That’s the way browser caching works. If it didn’t we would have to Ctrl+F5 every page we visit daily to wipe yesterday’s version from the cache.




 mtf:

That’s the way browser caching works.


I had no idea obviously, and wasn’t trying to be funny.
Why do I need to “special” reload a page to see my CSS changes then if it’s not because of caching?
To me it made sense in the way that it saves time and bandwidth to cache a stylesheet for a limited time which - I thought - browsers do naturally because we don’t expect sites to change CSS frequently.
Sorry if I did spread false information.

It was the behavior you describe which I found funny, not your comments. Nothing to apologize for. It’s been a while since I worked with response codes but I think somethng in the 300s is the response from the server if a cached file has not been changed on the server. The file is not sent down if this is the response.
Browser caching is a way to limit unnecessary bandwidth and reduce latency for a site that has hundreds or thousands of requests per minute. The more resources such as script libraries, style sheets, images, audio and video files, etc. that can be cached, the faster each page load or repeated visit will occur.
When we F5, all changed files should download. If in your case it only happens when you flush the cache first, then I have no explanation for that. One could speculate or surmize it has something to do with the server, or variant browser behavior, but that is just conjecture. If you find out more about this topic, do please bring us up to speed with you discoveries.

I didn’t know. Thank you! 

Guess I got the connotation wrong.

#primary li {

Ok I misunderstood. When it said to end before row 5 it meant to end at 4. I thought It meant AT 5.
So the caption in the bottom reading “This will have the element take up rows 2, 3, 4 and 5.” was regarding the wrong answer: grid-row: 2 /6; NOT the right answer grid-row: 2 / span 3; right?

What happens to the web page in the browser?""
well what does happen? i couldnt tell
","
body {
  background-color: #FFF;
  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

Visually, it does nothing.
edit: for me, it actually removes a “white border ish thing” around the whole thing, if I look closely 
Under the hood: in this example it takes the values for margin and padding and (re)sets them to 0 on the body selector, picking the body will make sure every element that is inside of the body and uses a margin or padding will be reset to 0 first, then use whatever you told them to. (I might have gotten that wrong, maybe that’s what the * selector does…)
Every code that now follows will change the margin and padding based on 0.
Why do this? Like stated in the exercise, there’s a user agent stylesheet, that’s simply the standard CSS for unchanged CSS selectors your browser will apply whenever your CSS doesn’t change the selector in question.
Imagine, those CSS values you don’t touch will be at the standard value of your preview browser when styling your website, and you think they fit. Now imagine a user browsing your site using a completely different browser that uses different standard values… it might look completely different - and CSS is just for avoiding that.
Especially for developers, resetting defaults in your CSS first, then styling your webpage is very much recommended.
There are CSS reset sheets online that can be used to reset pretty much every possible CSS selector.

271,[CSS Display and Positioning] : Linking to Questions,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
(First thing : I deeply apologize for my poor english)
Hello !
At the end of this lesson (CSS Display and Positioning), I’ve decided to link the < li >'s ""QUESTION""s from the header to the according questions in the content of the page.
When clicking on the links in the header, I’ve noticed that the header was covering the questions, since it was set on position: fixed;.
To solve this issue, I’ve added a new < div > above each of the questions in index.html, like so :
<div class=""Q"" id=""Q1"">
    <p>question 1</p>
</div>

and used these < div >'s ids to link to the header.
Then in style.css, I’ve set these < div >s like this :
.Q {
  visibility: hidden;
}

The blank space it created added enough space to solve the problem.
I would like to know if this is a proper way to fix this kind of issue, or if there is a more appropriate way to do so.
Thanks in advance ! I hope it was understandable enough…
","
I would advise you gave the <h4>Question ... </h4>s a padding-top.

@ 14cowado Thank you for your answer !
The problem with the padding-top is that :
- it makes the page “less visually appealing” because of all the space it adds before the questions.
- if I set the padding-top at 50px, Questions 2 to 5 appear correctly, but Question 1 is still hidden by the header.
- if I set the padding-top at 100px, Question 1 appears correctly, but it adds a lot of white space between the header and Questions 2 to 5.
I guess I could set a padding-top of 100px to the Question 1 and a padding-top of 50px to the Questions 2-5, but I find the way it renders not pleasing, visually speaking (I know I’m pernickety, but, well, initially I’m a graphist…).
Is the solution using the hidden < div >s  not recommended because it’s not how we are supposed to use this property ?

Do you have a LINK element in the HEAD with an href set to styles.css?

Yes, I do. I have even tried renaming the .css file a different name

So your index.html and styles.css file are in the same directory? Can you show us your link tag, please?

<link href=“style.css” type=“text/css” rel=“stylesheet”/>


Be sure to use standard quotes. The above look like smart quotes (or whatever they’re called).
<link href=""style.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

I am not sure I understand, I’m using Notepad++ to write the code.

The smart quotes I’m referring to look like word processor characters, not the standard vertical ones. It might be they got changed when you posted the code. Use four spaces to post a single line of code that preserves formatting.
That being the case, I see nothing wrong with your tag. Just so long as the name matches the file, and the file is in the same directory as index.html.
Add a line to your CSS just to see if it takes…
body { background-color: green; }

save and refresh the page. Does the background change to green? If so, your file is linked and loaded as we would expect.

No it did not change

I got the file to work be copying the first few line from an html I had written earlier that worked. I cannot identify the difference.

sorry but the current lesson does not give out the full code for the exercise there is nothing to copy and paste and there is no example, frankly it’s pretty poorly explained

I googled it and what I think the answer is is that you have to add
^style^
table, td {

^/style^
right below your opening ^table^ element. (The ^ are the respective greater to or less than symbols - it codes if I use them, so that’ll have to do.)

","
Yes, we need to set a width. It can be fixed (px) or proportional (%, em, or rem).
The default width for all block level elements is 100% so there is no margin space. auto will give equal margins to both left and right so long as the element is less than the width of the window.
div {
    width: 95%;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

That will leave 25px margin on each side if the window width is 1000px.

Hello!
I’m trying to remove text padding when users view my Word Press website using a phone or tablet. I’m just interning as a marketer at a startup company and am completely new to coding. I just learned how to use padding to fix some of the spacing issues on the homepage.
I used padding for some of the photo captions (when right justified it sat in the margin rather than under the photo) as well as highlight paragraphs. It looks great on desktop but when viewed on a mobile browser it pushes the photo captions so they’re no longer right justified under photos, and the highlight paragraphs only display one or two words per line (I’ve removed the padding on these until I can come up with a solution). After researching a little on Google it appears I need to add a custom additional CSS code under Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS. I’ve tried a few different versions and this is last one I entered but it hasn’t changed the mobile view:
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
.site {
padding-left: 0px;
padding-right: 0px;
}

ul {

}

added to ul.nutrition as well, also adding
align-self: center;

279,Top Property,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
Hello Coders!!!
I’m new to programming. So, when i was dealing with exercise of CSS related to opacity.
I found a code called “top” (Mentioned in the photograph)
Can you help me to understand what is the use of “top” property???

question.PNG823×556 253 KB

","
Top property defines how much is the element positioned from the top of the document this can be changed so if position property is set to absolute then top will be counted from the document’s top, if position is set to relative then top will be counted from the parent element.
You can learn more about the position property here
Hope this helps 

Thanks for your valuable reply!!!
I’m extremely grateful to you for this kind help.
I hope i might help you in the coming future !!!


top won’t work for static positioned elements:
https://jsbin.com/lorozucobi/edit?html,css,output
as you can see, nothing happens. The aqua div isn’t pushed down. If you change the position to relative, you will see that the element is now moved down 100 pixels
furthermore, top and margin-top (margin-top has been covered right?) work quite different, look at this example:
https://jsbin.com/fenaniqota/edit?html,css,output
as you can see, the #first (aqua) element is pushed down, which also pushes the #second (orange) element down
however, if you change margin-top to top, you will see the #first aqua element partly disappear behind the #second orange element. This is because, when using top, the elements are rendered first, and then top is applied
sorry lolfail, but i have to correct you on this matter:



 lolfail:

so if position property is set to absolute then top will be counted from the document’s top


lets do any other example:
https://jsbin.com/xowefisuwe/edit?html,css,output
as you can see, i gave the #inner red element a absolute position, but it perfectly stays within the #outer lime element.
This is because absolute positioned elements are positioned relative to first non-static parent, if the absolute positioned element doesn’t have a non-static parent, then lolfails statement is true.
which again, we can prove. Go make #outer lime element static, you will see that #inner red element is positioned using the document edges.
Hope this helps

Could you please provide the html and css code. I will see if I can help you  .

There are 2 important types of elements in HTML you need to understand - Block Level and Inline Level elements. div, h1 and p are Block Level, meaning they will “[break] the flow of the content” (create a line break). Inline Level elements, such as the span tag, will “only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element”, meaning they will not add such breaks (check out this article to learn more).
TLDR: You need to make your block level tags render as inline level elements so they don’t break the flow of the content:
HTML:
<div>
  <div class=""headerdiv"">
    <h1>Parker's 3D</h1>
  </div>

visited links only take the color if the link has been clicked before. It will be recorded in the browser’s history as having been followed during this or a previous session.
It’s important that your rules are written in the order in which you have them in your example.

a:active

The correct order for all five is,
:link 
:visited 
:hover
:focus
:active

hover and focus may be switched around. The rest of the order is critical.

That’s because they are recorded in the history. Create a new link with fresh text and a different URL. It should be red. Once you click that link it will be green.

Pseudo-elements are keyword added to the selector that allows one o style a specific part of the selected element. CSS in used to apply styles in HTML mark-up. In some cases when extra mark-up or styling is not possible for the document, then there is a feature in CSS called pseudo-elements. It will allow extra mark-up to the document without disturbing the actual document.

A pseudo element is virtual, not written in the source HTML. We make it appear using CSS, only.
Say we have a resource link that appears throughout our site in various forms, but always one format, say, PDF.

Does Codecademy actually have a lesson on Flexbox?

Well, not really sure about it but I can tell Flexbox is being used as alternative to other grid techs in framework like as Bootstrap and Foundation. You can either enable Flexbox grids or any other CSS grid system available for such frameworks.



 fudge5962:

I don’t think so, I remember way back ago when I finished the CSS course and it hasn’t Flexbox. Also it is too specific to be teach in one course since its use is pretty easy thanks to the documentation available at their website.

Flexbox is being used a lot, from what I can tell. I didn’t think there was anything about it, but it mentioned it in the Intro to Grid.

@mtf @fudge5962 @kingdarboja @keo31
I was also wondering about the missing Flexbox lesson, as the Introduction to Grids makes it sound like we’ve missed an important step.
I’ve managed to find it in the Web Development Path syllabus - it’s at the end of Section 4 (Getting More Advanced with Design) under Layout with Flexbox. Here’s a link to the actual lesson Flexbox, and in the syllabus you’ll also find a project. This Path includes a lesson on Flexbox, but doesn’t seem to include CSS Grid - strange…
@mtf also posted a link to an article on Flexbox here.
I’m interested to know if it would be recommended to take the Flexbox lesson before moving onto CSS Grid (after having already completed the Box Model and CSS Display and Positioning lessons)?

I would recommend taking the Flexbox lesson because CSS Grid probably gonna rely on it unless… it is done purely by hand 




 kingdarboja:

unless… it is done purely by hand


Not sure what you mean by that…?
I’ve actually gone ahead and taken the first CSS Grid lesson (CSS Grid Essentials) before checking out Flexbox, and so far it’s been no problem without Flexbox knowledge… 
I will go back and do Flexbox eventually, though 

It matters not which order assuming we are sticking to the one as we learn. Both are adopted into the CSS API and have their own intrinsic value. We need not complicate a simple design layout, or reach for too many tools.
It’s the delivery process that is the deciding factor. How simple, how scalable, how social, seem to be the gauge. Purpose based design considerations are tantamount in meeting these goals. There is no magic sauce.
Does a design’s purpose necessitate incorporating both Grid and Flex? Then get it right and celebrate. That’s the bottom line. When we think we’re being clever, that’s when we get snafu’d.

Not needed. DIV is already a block level element by default.



 stevenburkhart:

.header { height: 69px; width: 100%; border-bottom: 1px solid seashell; }


LIkewise, the width is 100% by default so that property is not needed.



 stevenburkhart:

.logo img { height: 50px; float: left; padding-top: 9px; padding-left: 10px; }


Images generally do not take padding, but margin. When setting a float, be sure to give the element a width property, as some user agents will depend upon it. The same will apply to the UL.
Not sure which one is the ‘hero’ image.
Can you please post a screenshot of your page (the full page, DIscourse will make it fit).

Hoping I’ve pasted the screenshot correctly.

We only really need to segment on the right. Point out where your issue is.

Here’s a better screenshot.
I just changed to a larger screen and the problem was resolved and now I have a different one. The large “hero” image should be right up against the header’s bottom border. When I changed to the bigger screen, that was resolved, but now it is off center, which is something I was struggling with before.

I believe everything we need is in the red-line that accompanies the project. Give it a close study and check your layout against it.
It was so long ago I did this I’ve forgotten most of what I learned at the time. However, if I could create the page to match the red-line, then someone younger, smarter and with a sharper mind can do it. Remember, this is a flexbox project, so make full use of it.

Oh, I AM aware I can combine the paddings and margin to shorthand and just type in a single pixel amount instead of the four that are repeating the same amount. I’m following a book exercise and thats how they have it written

Have you tried
float: right;

Thanks Jannes,
I just did and I put it here:
    color: #000080;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 3px;
    margin: 5px;
    font-weight: bold;
    float: right;
}

But the height of the background wasn't tall enough, so I adjusted that to 5px in the ul


There wasn't space between the links, and I messed with that. I also decided to change the display from inline to inline-block. that moved the list back to the left, but it had the padding between them which appeared nicer

as you can tell, I'm struggling with knowing what to select and what elements to actually write in code. its more of a guessing game at this point rather than me knowing what itll look like when any given code is written on a selector. I don't even wanna attempt flexbox or grid yet. and for the life of me I don't know the relationship between relative and absolute positioning

","
When creating a navigation bar, I would put it inside a <nav>Navigation</nav> element rather than a <div> to help you distinguish it from other elements. You might also want to add an id to it to help in the case that you have multiple navigation bars.
The different values for the position property are:

static - Stays in the same place - default
relative - Is positioned relative to other objects on the page
fixed - Always stays in the same position, whether you scroll or not
absolute - Has a specific position on the page that does not depend on the position of other elements (unless it is inside an element)
sticky - Behaves as a normal static element until it hits the top of the screen, at which point it starts to behave like a fixed element

The above is used to specify how you will tell it its location.
The options for the display property are different in that they tell the object how to behave. The possibilities that you are likely to use are the following:

block - starts on a new line and takes up the full width unless specified otherwise
none - you can’t see the element
inline - Does not start on a new line; only takes up as much width as required unless specified otherwise
inline-block - The element itself is inline, but the elements inside of it are block elements
list-item - behaves like the <li>List Item</li> element
initial - Resets the property to default (depends on the element)
inherit - Does whatever the parent element does

Usually, you will use a block element when creating a navigation bar, as you want it to take up the full width. You will want to use either fixed, absolute, or sticky positioning.
Here’s an example of how I’d arrange it:
nav {
  display: block;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%
}

Note that when positioning block elements, if you do not specify a width, it will only take up the required width.
I hope that this answers your question!

They both point to the same directory. ./ is the current directory.

Or URL above is full, already? How it’s possible?




 askerovtamerlan:

That is a background image URL in CSS, not a SRC attribute in HTML.
src=""images/mountains.jpg""

is adequate enough if being imported into index.html. Same as,

As for accessing files on the local machine, avoid referencing the drive root. It is not the site root, HelloWorld is.

Thanks! So the dot acts as jump to previous directory.




 jun_park:

So the dot acts as jump to previous director


When its a double dot, yes. A single dot is the current directory.

From what I can gather, when the relative path specifies a file in the same directory, the ./ is optional - is that correct?
e.g. When we are linking to a file style.css from a file index.html, and both files are in the same directory, my understanding is that we can write either of the following:
<link href=""./style.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

OR
<link href=""style.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

What I’m more unclear about, is whether the ../ is also optional when the relative path needs to specify a file in a different directory, but within the parent directory…
For example, in CSS Typography - Font-Face III, we are asked to add an src declaration to an @font-face rule set, which has a relative path to a file in a different directory (fonts) within the same parent directory.
The task allows:
  src: url(""../fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"") format(""truetype"");

But it doesn’t allow:
url(""/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")

or
url(""fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")





 jon_morris:

the ./ is optional - is that correct?


They are equivalent, so yes.



 jon_morris:

src: url(""../fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")


That path points to the parent directory of the current one (with index and style).
parent/
    fonts/
        Glegoo-Regular.ttf
    project/
        index.html
        style.css

""/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf""

points to the site root, if a web server, else the volume root if our own computer. This will not do since our project here is buried in a path of several directory levels.
""fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf""

assumes fonts is in the same directory as index.html.

Thanks, that’s really helpful… the only things I don’t understand from your reply are “site root” and “volume root” (but I get the basic idea that just using the forward slash won’t work )

site root is the directory mapped to a domain’s home page.
example.com/index.html

volume root refers to the lowest directory of your hard drive, as in C:\. On our local system we generally keep our files in a user documents directory which is not on the volume root.

In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

Maybe just different variations to use.
Hope this helps.
(Where I found the 1st answer:https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+diffrence+between+class+and+id&ie=&oe=)

The differences between class and id:

Multiple elements can share the same class, but only one element can have an id. This is helpful once you start changing the content of elements after the page loads. The page knows that only one element has a certain ID, so all it needs to find the element is the id
An element can only have 1 ID, but it can have multiple classes at the same time. This makes an ID much more specific than a class.

The order you put the class and the element in tell it where to find the element. The second item should always be inside the first element. For example, div .description tells it to find all elements with the class “description” inside a div. However, a description is not likely to be part of a header, but the other way around. Therefore it says to find the h5 element that is inside an element with the class “description”.
I hope that helps! If you have any more questions, let me know.

303,Problems with css animations,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
Hello everyone! 
I’m writing a single page website and anything was fine until I added some css animations to the main title.
The animations work, but the whole title shifted up in the page!  I tried to see what can be the cause of this but I hadn’t luck so far.
Could anyone help me please?
Thank you so much!
Here is the code: https://codepen.io/francesca829/pen/VgeRWj
P.S. It’s not really a problem. I adjusted the positioning, but I’m wondering why it happened.
","
I couldn’t recreate your issue enabling or disabling the animations. As long as your fix works on all media devices and browsers you’re trying to support, I’d say roll with it!

Thank you imnacho! Luckily it seems to work    but how weird!

304,Intro to grid,"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
This grid stuff in CSS is confusing, can someone help thanks.  
","
Grid Layout  gives us a method of creating  grid  structures that are described in  CSS  and not in HTML. It helps us to create  layouts  that can be redefined using Media Queries and adapt to different contexts. Unlike with an HTML table-based  layout , you can layer items on the  grid.
For example, you can make grids with rows and columns.
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}

and of course have to ability to make gaps in the grid you can make.
.grid-container {
display: grid;
 grid-column-gap: 50px;
}

There are also headers (top of page), footers (bottom of page), just as an example. The grids overall are here to help you organize your your code into boxes. If you need help with any of the grid code, let me know so I can help.

308,CSS animations,"Get Help,CSS",,8,"
I want to make the balls change their z-index every turn(I mean every half turns because the back and forth movement is one animation)

So here’s the HTML:
<div id=""firstL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""secondL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""thirdL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""fourthL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""fifthL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""sixthL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""seventhL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""eighthL"" class=""left""></div>
<div id=""firstR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""secondR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""thirdR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""fourthR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""fifthR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""sixthR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""seventhR"" class=""right""></div>
<div id=""eighthR"" class=""right""></div>

Here’s the CSS:

.left {
  position: relative;
  left: 45%;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 30px;
  height: 30px;
  background-color: red;
  animation: right 4s ease-in-out infinite;
  z-index: 2;
}
.right {
  position: relative;
  left: 55%;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 30px;
  height: 30px;
  background-color: blue;
  top: -280px;
  animation: left 4s ease-in-out infinite;
  z-index: 1;
}
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
@keyframes right {
  0% {
    left: 45%;
    z-index: 2;
  }
  25% {
    left: 55%;
  }
  50% {
    left: 45%;
    z-index: 1;
  }
  75% {
    left: 55%;
  }
  100% {
    left: 45%;
  }
}
@keyframes left {
  0% {
    left: 55%;
    z-index: 1;
  }
  25% {
    left: 45%;
  }
  50% {

  75% {
    left: 45%;
  }
  100% {
    left: 55%;
    z-index: 1;
  }
}

Just in case, here’s the link.
Right now it changes every turn(not the half of the animation, it changes after the balls meet for the second time, the full animation)
On the first run it changes when they(the balls) meet after the animation is complete and it re-runs the same ball is “up” and the other ball should be “down”(z-index)
Any help would be appreciated 
","
Sorry, but I’m confused on what you’re saying. They move left and right, so you want it to move up and down then? Is that what you’re trying to say?

No, they move right and left, but every time they meet they should change their z-index property

Ok. That clarifies a thing for me. I may be blind, but I don’t see a moving out property persay. I don’t see a property to move it.
animation: left 4s ease-in-out infinite;
There is that, but it doesn’t seem to connect there. Look at what this person used here as a example that may help you. If it doesn’t help, I’ll try to guide you more.


I don’t have a problem with moving, the problem is that every turn(left and right movement) the balls should change their z-index CSS property so at one turn red is up and in the next turn blue is up(I mean one time red covers blue and in the next move, blue covers red)

Oh. I see now. Right now its two red, then two blue.



 lolfail:

z-index: 2;


I think that and z index 1 needs changed for it work. I put all the z index numbers to 1, and it made blue forever stay on top. I’m working on it, and will get back to you soon.

thank you  the first works just when hitting run so the problem maybe is at the and of the animation

Your welcome! I trying a way right now that may work besides answering 30+ notifications

",
310,"Nesting, Grouping CSS Selectors","Get Help,CSS",,1,"
Honestly just looking for some clarification as for some reason this concept seems to be giving me a bit of a hassle.
Am I correct in assuming that when nesting CSS selectors that it should be listed from most specific to least?  If it is not a nested element but only a group of elements does is matter if it is in order of specificity?
Ex. if I was asked to Set the #banner .content h1 width to 400 pixels. as I am in the Box Model section of the CSS course, it would be written like:
#banner .content h1 {
width: 400px;
}

#ID (very specific) .class (less specific) h1 (tag which would not be specific at all).
Also, the difference between grouping and nesting:  The way I read it is grouping is if you want a group of elements regardless of where they are in the HTML page to be formatted a particular way you would do that by separating each element with a comma and keep them on one line.  But nesting is where you only want to format a particular section of the document which is controlled  as in the situation show in the above code.
Not really sure why this is giving me pause but before I get too deep I just want to make sure I am rationalizing this correctly in my head.
Thanks in advance

I thought I understood padding vs margin but this exercise has left me extremely confused. I have no idea how to answer it, even after looking at the solution
","
Margin  is outer space of an element, while  padding  is inner space of an element.  Margin  is the space outside the border of an element, while  padding  is the space inside the border of it.  Margin  accepts the value of auto:  margin : auto , but you can’t set  padding to auto.
I hope this helps =)

312,Animation run even after de-hovering,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
So is there a way to make a CSS animation continue even after leaving it with the mouse, I could use JS but I prefer CSS animations because JS animations are sometimes buggy.
I want to rotate a Font Awesome undo icon(animations works on them) and when leaving it with the mouse it would continue it’s animation like nothing happened.
HTML
<p class=""fa fa-undo""></p>

CSS
.fa {
  font-size: 25px;
  transition-duration: 1.25s; /*It's here because I couldn't figure it out*/
}
.fa:hover {
  transform: rotate(-360deg); /*so it will rotate counter-clockwise*/
  transition-duration: 2s;
}

The icon looks like this(just in case):

Any help would be appreciated.

You could try WebKit.
It’s not supported in older browsers though, only from:
Chrome 43.0
Edge 10.0
FireFox 16.0
Safari 9.0
Opera 30.0
I haven’t worked with it a lot, but it is quite easy to use.
Firstly you’ll need a function that does the animation:
@keyframes myRotate {
    from {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
        transform:rotate(-360deg);
    }
}

What is does is rotates it from it’s normal position, to 1 full rotation.
Next you have to assign this to the element you want to rotate:
<p class=""fa fa-undo""></p>

The CSS:
.fa {
    font-size: 25px;
    -webkit-animation: myRotate 2s infinite;
    -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;
}

To make it rotate, you just need the one line -webkit-animation: myRotate 2s infinite;. You first tell it which function to use “myRotate” (This is just a name I chose, it’s the same as what you called this: “@keyframes myRotate”. Second is the time it takes for 1 full rotation. Lastly the infinite just tells it to continue indefinitely.
With just the 1 line the element will rotate, but it will stop just before starting the next rotation (this is a nice effect for a loading element).
If you want a seamless rotation (without the pause to the next rotation), you have to add this line: -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;. Like it implies, it makes the transition linear.

Thank you for the answer, but it doesn’t work, it just keeps running, I don’t know if it’s my browser or anything, but thank you for the answer you gave me an idea on this.

Hello there,
Currently, I am doing the Tea Cozy exercise. I want to make the page fully responsive and I was wondering how I can make the ‘our mission’ banner scaleable.

Well I see two ways of doing this, the one you just said, use percentages, or there is a way, but it won’t gonna be the way you think, use media queries, there will be a lot to make it look like percentages, or just a few so it will only resize it if it’s a phone or a tablet… so as I said percentages are the elegant way, but if you want to try media queries:
@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 768px) {
  .banner {
    /*something*/
  }
}

This is the telephone size.
Also if you want to make it tablet compatible you can use:
@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1600px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .banner {
    /*something*/
  }
}

Portrait or landscape is the value that it accepts.
Here are the breakpoints(image from codecademy):

Hi @lolfail, thanks for the reply. Good to know that I found the best solution there, thanks for confirming. Yes, I didn’t want to use media query intentionally on this occasion but that’s definitely an option as well

You can do it like this:
The Link/ Anchor (You should be able to use most html elements):
<a>This is my Link</a>

The CSS:
a {
    background-image: none;
}
a:hover {
    background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}

What this CSS does is firstly change the background-image to nothing when you’re not hovering over it.
The other part (a:hover) only happens when you hover over the link. This changes the background to red at the top that gradually goes to yellow at the bottom

I have just completed the the last exercise of Flex box - Flexbox review.
I notice on Step 4 of the instruction that we set DISPLAY: INLINE-FLEX to the .col class.
But I tried also with FLEX and there is no difference. Why is that?

Why are the columns aligned next to each other even though I changed the display to flex?

2. Stray endtag (</div>) just before </body>




 colethelion321:

style=“width:100%”


This style rule should be in the CSS.
.card img { width: 100%; }

Avoid inline styles at all turns, especially those that are repeated. Only in exceptional cases should an inline style attribute ever be used. When it applies to only a single page of many, then an embedded style sheet (in the HEAD) can be written to that page, or a custom sheet imported (last in load order).
I’m not a big fan of the universal selector, owing that in older browsers it comes at a huge expense on resources. Maybe today’s browsers do a better job of mapping, but I will need to be convinced there is a tangible value to universal selector rules. If you are well informed and have an argument for this rule, please oblige us.
Regardless what box model we use, it is tricky to dial in the precise width of float containers. I have found over the years that it is advantageous to give a little bit of leeway. Test with 33%, and reduce until you have a nice fit on all three columns.
From a standpoint of organization, @media queries should be at the bottom of the style sheet. It also puts them lower in the cascade so everything else is already declared, and easier to override.
Going to test your page locally and will get back to you with my findings.

Okay, did the minor tweaks to the HTML and touched up the style sheet, old school…

So the reason I did a bang up job is because DevOps wasn’t working and I did this by hand. Not using an IDE or editor.

Thank you so much for your help. I really really appreciate it.
Much love, -Cole lyons.

If you need some explanation of my reasoning, just ask. I use a text editor and a browser. Nothing fancy. If you never work with CSS 1 and 2 on purpose you never learn the bridges we have to cross that Bootstrap, Flexbox, and Grids have helped to jump. Learn the early approaches, even if you don’t use them in your production work.

Yes, It is not possible to set a image on the html tag since it also contains the head and body element. all visual stuff should be added on the <body> element or children of the <body> element.

Why the header and the posts are not where they are supposed to be?
Thank you very much!

Nice question @francesca829!

Why the header and the posts are not where they are supposed to be?

Well, you can change the coordinates to do it.
`
grid-template: repeat(9, 1fr) / repeat (9, 1fr);
`
It depends where you want this. You currently have it in this position.
Another factor could be the grid bar, and it then falls into that layout. I don’t see anything wrong with that code. I just think you need to change the coordinates to get it what you want.
I hope this helps =)

Thank you @trevorhodges!
It seems to me that I need to experiment with the grid to fully understand it. The funny part is that more experiments = more questions!

Ok! I’ll be happy to help to the best of my abilities =)

Oh thank you so much for your help! 
I found out that while I can easily move the first item (header) on the grid, I can’t do it with the second (post1)!
I can’t even assign it to an area.
Maybe it’s something silly but I couldn’t figure it out yet. 
My code isn’t very different from the code used in the lessons, so why?
Second - I noticed that even if I set width and height of my container, its height changes according to the items’s content.  Is it normal? It doesn’t happen so in the lessons.

Second - I noticed that even if I set width and height of my container, its height changes according to the items’s content.  Is it normal? It doesn’t happen so in the lessons.

Yes. The HTML usually defaults unless you change the width and height.

I found out that while I can easily move the first item (header) on the grid, I can’t do it with the second (post1)!
I can’t even assign it to an area.
Maybe it’s something silly but I couldn’t figure it out yet.

The header is in place already, so if I’m not mistaken, it will probably have to stay like that. Though this so far is better than a lot of my codes. I don’t think its silly, don’t worry. I make mistakes too. If your code is different, that is ok. Just review the lessons to make sure everything is right. If you want to see my mistake, the post is here.

Hi Trevorhodges  
It helped, yes! I finally got what was wrong. It’s really a beginner mistake. 
Now I’m playing with the grid and experimenting different arrangements.
I’m wondering though how many ways there are of building a layout. There is the grid. The flexbox which should be used in conjunction with the grid as far as I know. Are there others?

There are quite a few ways to set up things. First, is simply a basic layout that only goes from top-to-bottom. Take a look at the CSS Course for some of that. I’ll try to get some helping links =)

323,Azure appears white not blue,"Get Help,CSS",,6,"
In the  Olivia Woodroof Portfolio css-exercise there is one task to change the color of the h1 tag to Azure. I have done this with
h1 {
  color: Azure;
}

But it results in a white text. But Azure has to be a kind of blue (#007fff). If I use the rgb-value I get a blue color.
Note that also in the accompanying solution video the color Azure seems to be a kind of white and not blue color.
Any idea what is wrong here?

 peterbaumgartner6753:

But Azure has to be a kind of blue (#007fff). If I use the rgb-value I get a blue color.


I dont think this is right. The hex value of Azure is #F0FFFF. Here are all the colors css recognizes by word and the hex/rgb values that come with it.
It is indeed very white but still a bit blue.

Oh thanks. That is strange because I took my value from en dot wikipedia dot org slash wiki slash Azure_(color) but also from other websites like 99colors dot net slash name slash azure or colorhexa dot com slash 007fff.
(Sorry, I am only allowed to write two links)
But looking around I have seen this blueish white also:  htmlcsscolor dot com slash hex slash F0FFFF
w3schools dot com slash colors slash colors_names dot asp
So I am a little confused. Are there two colors Azure?
By the way: In my understanding, Azure is a deep blue because we use this name for the dark blue sky and for the Italian football team (Azurris because of their blue dress). 

I realy have no idea. I think css has its own values on named colors.
Personally i always use the hex or rgb value and type the name of the color in comments behind it. This will atleast always eliminate confusion.

Good to know. Thanks for your tip with  rgb/hex values and color names as comment behind it! This is better and prevents confusion…

No problem, good luck with your exercise.

325,How to create exceptions in CSS,"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
Here’s a link to what I’m currently working on: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/styling-a-website/modules/learn-css-selectors-visual-rules/projects/css-selectors
I was curious if there was any way to create an “exception” per se.
Here is my code:
 img {
  height: 180px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 3px solid white;
  display: block;
  
}
.description {
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
#cook-time {
  font-weight: bold;
}
.ingredients li {
  list-style: square;
}
p.time {
  color: white;
}
a.external-link {
  color: black;
}
html, body {
  font-family: Helvetica;
  background-color: rgb(128, 113, 113);
  padding: 20px;
  text-shadow:
		-1px -1px 0 #000,
		1px -1px 0 #000,
		-1px 1px 0 #000,
		1px 1px 0 #000;
  color: white;
}
h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

As you can see, I created a shadow around all text. I want to remove the shadow around the text a.external-link, and I also would like to add the shadow to the bullets and numbers in the lists.
What is the most syntax-respecting way to do this?
","
I think you can use :not() | selector not css tricks in order to achieve what you want  Just provide the element that you don’t want to apply the shadow along the ones you want separated by a comma.
Example:
html, body, a:not(:external-link) {
  text-shadow:
		-1px -1px 0 #000,
		1px -1px 0 #000,
		-1px 1px 0 #000,
		1px 1px 0 #000;

Would it be .green cursive or .green.cursive?
","
.green .cursive {
color: Green;

.green .cursive


This is not chaining, but descendant. It matches any cursive class that is a descendant of a green class.
<div class=""green"">
  <div class=""cursive"">

  </div>
</div>

To have a selector match an element that is both green AND cursive we literally do chain them…
.green.cursive {}

with no whitespace separating them.
<div class=""green cursive"">

</div>




 mtf:

with no whitespace separating them.




That makes sense. Never had to chain selectors before.

In pre-HTML5 browsers, it declares the MIME type the browser should expect. The type attribute value should match the MIME type written into the file header. HTML5 has made CSS the de facto standard for style sheets and no longer requires us to declate the type. The relation declaration is still required.
All in all, declarations in the meta data are for the browser to know, not the user.

331,Change background color in CSS (Light and Dark theme on site),"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
Hello, I have a question, I’m using a free template of HTML5 UP Editorial and want to make a button which will switch a theme from light to dark. I did it to one page, to main page, its switches to dark, but if I go to another page its resets to default light theme. Is it possible to make it dark on all pages if someone clicked a dark theme on main page? and again if someone click light it swtiches to light theme on all pages. Its 100% HTML so I dont know if I should use java, or other option.
Heres my workspace: http://foodtek.eu/pub/index.html (on the top-right corner - is icons to switch theme)
I wish to make it works like here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-lmi
","
The only ways to keep the theme going through other pages is to have the logic built in on the server side so the theme_id remains alive with subsequent page requests; or, to use an iframe that has access to global variables in the host page. Both are a bit complicated, but not insurmountable tasks.
Server-side is simplest if  you’ve never worked with or are unable to install an iframe in your index.html page. All it would take is a query string attached to subsequent page requests.
https://www.example.com/about.php?theme_id=teal

The request document (or the template from which it is generated) would resolve the URL with ISSET (in PHP) and assign the applicable style sheet or global variable, the latter of which could be written into a script that could act upon the CSS in the DOM.
Theme switchers have been around nearly as long as CSS itself. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen one for an iframe, but it should be feasible, if perhaps a bit impractical. I should think it would not be unheard of. My experience is more on the PHP side, so that’s what I would lean on. The same could apply regardless what CGI you are running, PHP, Python, Rails, .NET, etc.

link rel=“stylesheet” href=“C:\bootstrap\css\bootstrap.min.css”
I am uploading a picture of the incorrect layout (it should show both incorrect as well as correct). Does anyone have any insight on this? Hopefully I provided enough information to help. Does Bootstrap change the way some of their callouts are? I know the class style was version 3.3.6, whereas Boostrap latest is 4.1.3. Thank you in advance.

There were a lot of changes from bootstrap 3 to 4, you can see if what you want to do works the same in bootstrap 4 here.

So I just started the CSS series, and after only like 3 sections have run into a brick wall where the code will not work in Chrome, but will work when I complete it in Microsoft Edge of all things. At first I thought it was my ad-blocker but I have disabled all extensions and restarted chrome, and yet still cannot progress in this section unless I use Edge. It did work for the first 2 sections so oddly it’s not 100% broken in Chrome for me. Can’t imagine what would cause this if no extensions are active. For what it’s worth I also checked chrome://flags to make sure I didn’t have any crazy experimental settings on.

I was trying to have it so that my paragraphs all had a slightly transparent grey background, which I achieved. However, the background goes all the way across the page, but I want it to fit around the text like a box.

Thanks in advance for any help!
","
Paragraph text is not the ideal thing to style. Better that it were in a container, with the background applied to that. Set the width on the container and the paragraph will conform to that width. Also apply the padding to the container, not the paragraph.

I switched my styling to a div element containing the content I want to style. Adjusting the width fixed my problem with the background going all the way across the page, however when I try to add padding, it only affects the text, and not the background. I’m trying to move it just a bit away from the left, but I can’t seem to figure out how. Here is a screenshot of what I’m talking about!:

The grey background touches the left edge of my page, which I’m trying to avoid.

339,<nav> styling does not override <a> styling,"Get Help,CSS",,8,"
Hi there,
I’m really new to CSS. I have written one styling for the a element which automatically updates the design of the navigation too. I then specified different parameters for the nav section but it does not override the design of a (only the font-size weirdly). Can you help?
I thought I might work around it by using an id=“menu”. Is it correct that you can’t add it in the  tag as  but rather have to add it to each link as , or is there another way?

We will need to see your HTML to be able to answer this question.
Something to note,
a {}

nav a {}

The latter will override the generic selector as it is more specific. If a does not have a font-family, but nav does, then the anchor inside the nav element will inherit the font.

Yes. The first one blurs the actual text with no offset. Try it by itself in comparison to text with no text-shadow.

</div>

A simple approach is to use a float property on the image. It takes a little more structure to get it tightened up.
<div class=""section2"">    <!-- give this a `clear: both` property -->
  <h1>...</h1>
  <div>    <!-- give this element `position: relative` -->
    <img>  <!-- give this a `float: left` or `float: right` property -->
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</div>

Put a margin on the float object, not on the P. If float: left, then margin on the right, and vice-versa for float: right. A lot has changed in the past few years, but way back when I always put the float object before the text object.
This is old school, though, now that we have Flexbox and CSS Grid (and optionally Twitter Bootstrap.css).

I got stuck here.  Why can these three properties used together? flex-grow, then flex-shrink and then set a width basis? which setting will be applied to the element?
Since the width of the flex container or the parent element is defined and known by developers, either larger or smaller than the total width of the flex items, so i think either flex-grow or the shrink can be applied to, that is, if the width of the container is larger,  we use flex-grow, if it is smaller, than we use shrink.
Can anyone help me out with this problem?
Thanks in advance.
","
.big will grow twice as much as .small, and small will shrink twice as much as big The basis is only a minimum so the combined width will never be less than 250px.
Space around and between will affect position relative to each other and the boundaries. That will also have an impact on how small the window can be shrunk down to.
Assuming there is no space around or between and no margins, let’s say we start out with window width of 250 and stretch it to 400. That would mean big will now be 250px, and small will be 150. Stretch it to 550 and big goes to 350px and small to 200.
(Of the 150px change in overall width, big grows by 100, small by 50.)
Shrink from 550 down to 400, and small loses 100px off the hop; big gives up 50.  So now big is 300px and small is already back to basis. It cannot shrink any further.
If .big represents the main content, and .small represents the sidebar and/or navigation menu this favors the content as real estate goes. Who’s looking at the sidebar when adjusting screen width?

Got it! Thanks for your and answer and patience.

The  align-items  property spaces flex items vertically. Vertically right? but in the example above, it spaces the items horizontally.

Alignment is cross axis. Given the vertical direction, the cross axis is on the horizontal, hence centered left to right.

so it is because style.css is in “styles” folder so we need to go back to their parent folder.
But if style.css wasn’t in a folder, just “fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf” would do. Did I get the logic right?

No, not really. They are different aspects. However, they are similar in that neither will change the size of the page. visibiity doesn’t collapse adjacent elements, but hides the content from view.

I don’t know you, but in my world the line on top is called horizontal, I’m really confused right now.

They’re called vertical margins because they are on the cross-axis, which is vertical. Top and bottom are the vertical boundaries.

I had this exact thought. It seems like the lines going across the top and bottom are moving horizontally, so top and bottom  would be horizontal.
Since we’re talking about margin though, the top and bottom margins are measured by being pulled vertically either way. Once I saw it I couldn’t unsee.

Sorry, it seems I misunderstood the function of absolute vs fixed. I think I see that now.

That’s for the next lesson, (no. 5) which swaps out absolute and replaces it with fixed.

Nothing helps us learn like hands-on experimenting. Create a blank HTML page and save it as a template for all your test projects. Set out to learn as much as you can about one thing and exhaust all options.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
  <title>Always below the above line</title>
  <style>

  </style>
</head>
<body>

<body>
<.html>

Start a test folder on your machine and save this file as template.html. Open it in your editor and spin off a copy for each test project.
Notice that I have included an embedded style sheet so that your experimental CSS always stays with the test page. Don’t use an external style sheet for testing as it can get separated from the example.
When you post the link, we can play around with a few tests to get you started down that path.
Read this page, in the meantime, from start to finish.

 khmikool:

can anyone tell me where i’ve gone wrong?


You haven’t. What you are seeing is normal behavior as the browser attempts to keep elements in view, regardless how they may look out of place.

Extra Study
HTML is drawn to the screen from left to right, top to bottom, with element placement in the same order as the document source. This describes what is known as, normal flow.
To really study HTML, we need to stick to just markup with no styles, and certainly no script. Raw HTML is best learned cold (tongue in cheek). Learning the HTMLElements in their very basic form is the prima facia way to learn the user agent style sheet, namely the default style rules that apply in all browsers when no CSS is specified in the document.
Take your project for instance. Comment out the link element and open the page. See how everything flows? Block level elements take up the full width of the screen and any that are larger than the viewport width will force a horizontal scrollbar. The natural width of the page is equivalent to the largest object.
Paragraph text will flow to the right as far as the above width will allow, and then wrap. One of the key demands of a basic layout is preventing a horizontal scrollbar. Before CSS we did this with the width attribute, the first primary adaptive tool we had to work with when we had no control over physical size.
First, do as suggested and look at the page. Now add this attribute to all the img elements (except the logo; which is white on alpha)…
 width=""100%""

Again, with no styles added, save and refresh the page. Notice, no horizontal scrollbar?
This sort of adaptivity is not learned at all when we skip this stage of HTML study in pursuit of presentational style. It’s what I call stretching the limits of user agent styles before overriding with our own.
The page is plain, and doesn’t do a lot of justice, but think of the user who does not see the webpage, but listens to it; or the person who may see the page but have minimal interaction with it, such as a challenged user for whom eye candy is a distraction. Plain text presentations are appropriate in many scenarios. What’s important is getting the content to the user in the order we intended. That’s a cornerstone of accessibility.

What about the header section? When I open the html document in my browser the header section appears to have a gap between it and the top of the page. It is still fixed in position but there is a gap that reveals the rest of the content as I scroll.
Do you happen to know why this is? There should be no margin set to cause this.




 khmikool:

t is still fixed in position but there is a gap that reveals the rest of the content as I scroll.


The cure for this is to give the body
a top margin of zero…
margin-top: 0;




 khmikool:

There should be no margin set to cause this.


It’s an age old situation. A top margin of 10px has been around since forever. It may be in the user agent style sheet.

And i was about to say that i finished the same project today and wanted to ask a couple of things! :-)
Looking at khmikool’s code, i noticed that we have used several similar “techniques” to achieve the same result and some different ones. For example i used the flex method a bit more. During the course we learn about different layout techniques to achieve the result we want, like flexbox, grid, traditional box model etc. I wonder:

is there a way (a trick maybe) to identify which technique would be the best choice for a project or eventually you do that by experience? *best as being able to do more complex layouts easily,
should you combine techniques in the same page or its better to keep it consistent?


Any answer could be deemed subjective. Without ample experience or knowledge in using Flex, Grids, Bootstrap, etc. we cannot expect one to be better than another. A way to find out which you would rather work with is to create a stable raw layout without using any of the tools, only float and position, wrestle with it to meet your needs, then replicate it with the Flex, then with Grids, then with Bootstrap. Only once you have struggled with a few layout techniques will you be able to objectively decide which one best suits you and your workflow.
There is a reason that Flex, Grids, Bootstrap, etc. were created. Dig around a bit and you should find something about the advantages of each.

Tables when used as intended don’t need to be improved upon. They are for marking up data. Grid is a layout tool, not a table.

Thank you for your answer. I see. So you are saying that tables shouldn’t be used for layout but only for presenting data?




 mikegr:

tables shouldn’t be used for layout but only for presenting data?


Given everything at our disposal for adaptive and responsive layouts it would no longer be a viable consideration to use tables in layout. Tables are quite rigid and contain more structure than a typical layout would require. As data containers they are ideally suited to that role. If it’s tabular data, then use a table.
Conversely, using grids or other layouts to present tabular data is semantically incorrect since each grid section is independent of the others and search engines would have a hard time indexing. Tables give scope to columns and rows and data is related to its neighboring elements, beside, above or below.

Very informative! Thank you!

FYI, this adaptation is a direct paste-in of markup and style rules from,

Table example

actually, they all move. You can see this if you give the first question an id:
<div class=""question"" id=""question"">

and then only apply top: 40px to the id:
.question {
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  
}
#question {
  top: 40px;
}

you will see overlap between bottom of question1 and top of question2.

Now i get it. Yes they all move relatively to their original position, so that’s why also the rest of the question tags don’t move 40px lower relatively to the previous question tag. Makes sense! 
Thank you!

yep, exactly. I didn’t explain much, but you reached the conclusion yourself, in my opinion, that is even better

No. It refers to normal flow that all the other elements will adhere to, ignoring the absolutely positioned one since it has been taken out of normal flow. The absolute positioning is relative to only the parent object, assuming it has a position specified. If not then the object will be relative to the body element.

float is a typesetting term that describes how text floats around a picture, filling in the open space beside and below. The page section is larger than the picture.
<section>

372,What is the point of Grid?,"Get Help,CSS",,9,"
It behaves very similar to a Table, if a little bit more customizable. It tells the browser to display elements in a series of rows and columns. This is a matter of structure, yes? If it’s a structural thing, wouldn’t the best practice be to handle it in the HTML file as a Table?
My question is this: if the Table element in HTML and the Grid element in CSS accomplish a very similar task with a similar purpose, isn’t one of them an improper abstraction? Structure belongs in HTML, and style belongs in CSS, so if Table and Grid are both for the same purpose, be it a matter of structure or style, one of them is in the wrong place, right?
","
Table certainly has its usage, but grid does bring something extra features:
https://medium.com/@js_tut/new-things-css-grid-brings-to-the-table-e465cb5d2841
http://jensimmons.com/ -> design with grid video
both grid and table have there usages.

I understand that both have their usages. My question isn’t about their usefulness at all. My question is how can we reconcile the idea that “We should put structure in HTML, and style in CSS” with the fact that we have two similar tools that accomplish something quite like each other, one in HTML and one in CSS?

a <table> without css could achieve very little. And a css grid won’t work without html code. Html and css are so tightly weaved together.
i will do you one better, there is even display: table for css
in programming, there are often a dozen different ways to do something, which has advantages (you can make something perfect (or close to) but you have to choice the right option. Everything has pros and cons, so its your roll to judge.

That still doesn’t answer my question. It helps out a lot if I’m confused as to which one is more useful, but I’m not. They’re both tools, and they’re both useful, and I’ve got a pretty good grasp about when to use each.
What I’m confused about is an ideological question. Early on in HTML and CSS we learn the ideology that HTML is for structure and CSS is for style, and that we shouldn’t mix the two. Because the natures of Grid and Table are so similar I have trouble reconciling them with that ideology.
If arranging things in rows and columns is a matter of structure, then how can we say both “structure should stay out of CSS” and “we have a CSS tool that arranges things in rows and columns.”?
Likewise, if arranging things in rows and columns is a matter of style, then how can we both say “style should stay out of HTML” and “we have an HTML tool that arranges things in rows and columns.”?
One of those two tools must be counter to the narrative of separation of style and structure, right?




 fudge5962:

Early on in HTML and CSS we learn the ideology that HTML is for structure and CSS is for style


i disagree with this statement, css is not only for style, its also for positioning.
and both are within the ideology, both (table and grid) have a html structure and css styling and positioning.

After a little more reading, you’re right. Positioning is definitely a design/display concept, and definitely falls under CSS. As for Table, it’s still useful for structurally abstracting data into individual cells, but definitely shouldn’t be used to try and control how they display on-page.
I guess I was looking at it from the wrong perspective.

so, all good now? 

Wonderful. Thank you for taking the time to explain things for me.
"
373,Learn Responsive Design | Exercise 8 Question | Redundant Code?,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
Working through this lesson, I noticed there are 2 places in the stylesheet that edit the properties of images: once in the /* Universal Styles */ Section and again in the /* Blog Images */ Section (I’m using the term sections as the portions of CSS delineated by the comments).
The Question
Since the aforementioned code edits the same classes, is it simply “poorly written” (in this particular instance) to have it split up between two “sections” of the stylesheet, or is there some type of hierarchy/parent-child relationship thing that makes this more important than I can tell?
Context for My Brain
I understand why this splitting-the-code-up-across-multiple-sections could make sense in a real-world setting, but for the purposes of this practice course, it is confusing. The CSS implies that they are editing the same classes (.image, .image-container) but in two different places, and I’m not familiar enough with parent-child relationships within CSS to know if that’s even a line of thinking worth pursuing.
","
It has to do with child-parent relation ship.
example:
.image{
}

Would give CSS to every element with the class image regardless if it has a parent or not.
Another example:
.image-container .image{
}

Would add CSS to every element with the class name image that also has a parent with the class name image-container.
This means that elements with the class name image that don’t have a parent with the class name image-container would not get this CSS.
Another way of getting the same results would be:
.image-container{
    //css for parent
    .image{
         //css for child of .image-container
    }
}

This is usually not used by beginners since it could be confusing. But it could also clarify things since you will get a visual of a tree view(which might make the parent child relation more clear).
In case the parent doesn’t have any own CSS you could simplify it:
.image-container .image{
    //css for child of .image-container
}

Its opinion based tho. Both are acceptable ways of creating CSS

Perhaps I wasn’t clear. I totally get what you explained but the code in the lesson (and my point of confusion) is more like the following:
/* Universal Styles */

.image-container {

}

img {

}

/* Blog Images */

.image-container {

}

img {

}

And I am wondering why they exist under two different section headings even though they seem to be editing the same HTML classes/things.

Yea that seems dirty. They probably did that because of the commenting, so you can clearly see what piece of css does what to what element. Even tho it is the same element.
I could see benefit in this way if you just want to add something to an exciting file where the class already exist and you don’t want to read the whole css file. Its kind of a lazy way tho since “ctrl+f” will find you the class for you.
I would advise to not use this style. It will cloud your css file real quickly and you will probably get a mess once you start to overwrite properties.
I agree, this can be very confusing if you already know some css but are still learning.
Watch out tho, the lesson you provided in the link has the flowing css:
/* Universal Styles */
.image-container {
  
}

.image-container img {
  
}
/* Blog Images */

.images {
  
}

.images .image-container {
  display: inline-block;
  
}

This can not be compared to the code you gave.
for example img is not the same as .images
img reffers to the <img/> element while .images reffers to any element with the classname .images
This means that in the link to the lesson you gave there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the css

Apparently I’m just a poor reader. Missed the unfortunately small detail of it being a .image class and a .images (plural) class. That just feels like a bad (although understandable) naming convention. Thanks for clearing that up for me.

Perhaps this isn’t the best example, but if you’re going to put something on your website in the first place, why would you turn around and  hide it? I’m not sure I understand why that would be necessary. For example, the exercise has you make the “Donate” link hidden. Why would anyone in their right mind have a donate link hidden? Isn’t the entire idea of this particular model to tout what the group has been doing to preserve Lake Tahoe and wouldn’t they want donations? I don’t know… maybe it’s too early in the morning (or actually too late at night as I haven’t been to sleep yet,) but it really makes no sense to me.
Below is the link to the exercise to which I refer:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-box-model/lessons/box-model-intro/exercises/box-visibility?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
","
This lesson seems to be more about teaching a concept.
display none can be very handy for a drop down menu for example. Or the hamburger menu codecademy uses in the exercises (icon in the bottom left)
but these examples might be too complex at first, so the exercises opts for something simpler to just demonstrate how the concept works

ok, I do get that concept. However, what I’m asking is why you would want or need to hide something? Is there a purpose for it?




 stetim94:

display none can be very handy for a drop down menu for example. Or the hamburger menu codecademy uses in the exercises (icon in the bottom left)


i cover this? If i make a drop down menu, the items should be hidden by default only be displayed once clicked/hovered?

a very basic implementation of dropdown:
http://jsbin.com/nokatatepu/edit?html,css,output
see that if you hover over the dropdown menu, the items appear? Quite useful

Wasn’t sure if you’d covered it or not, since display is different than visible, correct? See below. So, if you make something hidden, then the space is reserved and you can make a drop-down menu later and the items previously hidden would be shown?
This is a quote from the lesson:
Note:  What’s the difference between  display: none  and  visibility: hidden ? An element with  display: none  will be completely removed from the web page. An element with  visibility: hidden , however, will not be visible on the web page, but the space reserved for it will.

True, visibility: hidden also exist, when is the last time i used that? Must be long time ago
yep, this article agrees with me:
Honestly, the visibility property is not something we used very frequently, and certainly not on its own. If we are also using other CSS properties like positioning to achieve the layout we wanted for a certain element, we could then use visibility to hide that item initially, only to “turn” it back on hover. That is one possible use of this property, but again, it is not something we turn to with any frequency.
so the same as i did for my dropdown menu, except when you need to keep the element in position (otherwise the layout might be messed up)
the lesson does not give a very practical example, given you would need to add a hover.

Thank you! That’s what I was looking for.

And my apologies as I didn’t see the response with the link in it regarding a “dropdown” that when you hovered over it, the list items would appear. Interesting! Thanks so much for your patience! I did try to explain that it was late for me, right? hahahaha

no problem, we achieved the desired result

Isn’t the first one we learned “tag name selector”?


Selector is another term to describe an element, which is made up of tags and content/and or attributes.
<p>        => tag      (OPENTAG)
</p>       => tag      (ENDTAG)
<p></p>    => element  (selector)

id and class are special attribute selectors tied to specificity.
p {}       => node type selector      =>  0 0 0 1
.class {}  => class selector          =>  0 0 1 0
#id {}     => id selector             =>  0 1 0 0
style=""""   => inline style selector   =>  1 0 0 0

The only higher specificity is !important whch is a clear signal there is an inline style somewhere that maybe shouldn’t be.
Any attribute can be specified in a selector, indicated by [attr].
<span lang=""fr""></span>

span {}              => node type selector
span[lang] {}        => node with attribute selector
span[lang=""fr""] {}   => node with attribute with value selector

377,Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
The title of the topic is a lesson in CSS.
The #6 exercise in this lesson reads thus:
At the bottom of the page, there’s a link to the full recipe. Let’s make the link a different color.
Notice that in  index.html , on line 42, there is a  p  element with a class of  citation , then an  a  element inside of it with a class of  external-link . Navigate to  style.css  and write a selector using  external-link  class.
Then, add this code inside of the selector’s curly braces:
color: SeaGreen;
The answer is this according to the video:
.external-link {
color: seagreen;
}
What I had done, and it worked just as well, was this:
p.citation .external-link
.external-link {
color: seagreen;
}
Other than the obvious - that being less coding - what is the difference?
Mahalo!

 coder_brewer:

p.citation .external-link


Too much specificity. This can come back and bite us. The implication is that external links in citation class paragraphs will be different from external links elsewhere. The above design implies all external links will be the same.
.external-link {
    color: seagreen;
}

Not all browsers support named colors the same way. If you look at the named colors list, you will see what most recognize.

Just that one, which selects external links that are children of a citation paragraph. It would not include all external links, as one would assume is the intention of this designer.

378,Selector issues,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
I am on exercise 13/15 on CSS Gris Essentials, and when I took the solution route it displayed the selector classes of "" .a and .b "" although the class identifier in HTML is = to "" box a and box b "". Why?
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-grid/lessons/css-grid-i/exercises/grid-col?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
","
An element can have multiple classes assigned to it. In this case, each element has two classes.
""box a""
""box b""

We can assign different rules to each class, separately (as would be expected).
.box {}
.a {}
.b {}

If there were other elements with either a box class only, or an a or b class only, they would also be affected by these rules. We could isolate elements with both by writing the selector,
.box.a {}
.box.b {}

so it would apply only to elements with both classes. Note that there is no space between the class selectors (which would make them descendant selectors).

Thank you for explaining that! I completely forgot that I can specify more than one class in a single identifier.

I assigned one element to grid-area: 3 / 7 / 6 / 24; and it appeared to be in the correct location.
I then assigned another element to grid-area: 10 / 7 / 14 / 24; which should be below my first item.

Three things would be helpful here, starting with a link to the exercise. Please copy the URL from the location bar of that page and paste into a reply. Thanks.
Second, we need to examine your actual code. We cannot see it at that link, but can test it in our own profile workspace, given we are on the same page. Plus it gives us an opportunity to comment and advise.
Third, and optional, though it is helpful, a screenshot of the output to the screen so we can relate better to your question about shifting of the grid components.
Aside
We see you have another post on the Grid subject. Is it the same lesson or a different one? If it is different, go back and add the lesson link and your code so we don’t have to go through this whole charade again. Thanks.

So I’m having a lot of trouble positioning various items with a grid.

No short-hand exists to combine all of these values. These are all  different  properties, unlike,  background , which has colors, images, positions and repeat instructions and as such  can be squashed into a short-hand form.

actually, there is a shorthand. Full out it would be:
padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px;

with the shorthand you only have to write 20px once and 30px once. So that qualifies as shorthand, good you found it @lpdiddy5

Your button should have a width property. text-align applies to contents of an object, not the object itself. For that you can use, margin: 0 auto;, or alternately, give the parent container a text-align property to apply to its children.

Absolute positioning is out of normal flow so margins and centering are not on the table.
Let your width on the div span the page, then give your button a width (say 100px) and margin: 0 auto. If you want some whitespace above and below the button, then change the 0 to 1em. If you give the button a height: 2em, and a line-height: 2em, the text will center vertically. To center the text horizontally, give the button a text-align: center property.
Since you have a style sheet, move the style rules for the H2 there. The sty attribute in your code is broken, for one, and inline styles as so not the way to write HTML.
h2 {
  color: #0099ff; /* shorthand... #09f */
  text-align: center;
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}

Mastering CSS is not something one can do in a few weeks, or even months. It takes most people years to really build a foundation of techniques and ways to overcome challenges. When you no longer have to wrestle with it, you know you are getting somewhere.
Because of the Living Standard approach being taken with HTML/CSS and ECMAScript the API’s will continue to evolve. Intimate familiarity with the existing recommendations makes it much easier to understand and adopt new ones as they emerge.
For extra study, find some JavaScript visual effects and attempt to emulate them using only CSS. You’ll be amazed by how much we can do without script. In fact I recommend to every author that their pages should not depend upon script to give the user a good experience. Yes, script is a necessity, but it does not need to be applied to visual aspects as much as we might think.
Only when we go down that road with some serious intentions do we begin to learn the trade-offs, and where script has advantage over CSS (or the reverse). With the increase in power and speed of modern devices there may be less of a concern either way, but one should be able to reason things out and that takes experience. Lots and lots of experience.

Many thanks for your indepth response Roy. Equally daunting and inspiring.
It’s going to be a long journey for me then 
Cheers
Sean

actually the offset applied to all elements, i could demonstrate this but you provided no code and no exercise url, so its difficult to craft an example.
so here is what you can do to prove the offset applied to all elements, you give the first question an id:
<div class=""question"" id=""prove"">

then remove top: 20px; from .question and apply the it to #prove:
#prove {
   top: 20px;
}

now you will see overlap between bottom of first question and top of second question
here is the thing with top, first the elements are positioned on the page, then they are all pushed down 20px, making it look like only the first element has moved down

Thank you.

nope, that is not the case.
if you implement my suggestion:
  <div class=""question"" id=""question"">
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <h2>I like participating in physical activity such as running, swimming, or biking.</h2>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Disagree</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Neutral</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Agree</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

.question {
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  
}
#question {
  top: 20px;
}

you can now see overlap, so this proves that you don’t move the whole box
top is applied after the elements are on the page, so all .questions move down 20px, keeping there relative distance to each other, so only a gap becomes visible above the first question.

When would I link a url as a stylesheet? How does a url act as a stylesheet?
","
an url doesn’t act as a stylesheet, but we can use an url or path for the href attribute of <link>, to load a stylesheet from another website (which then often is a CDN)
For example bootstrap offers CDN (content delivery network) so if we need bootstrap we could just do:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" heft=""https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css"">

now we can use bootstrap.
the url could also be a relative or absolute path of a css file on the same machine/computer/server, although its then more often referred to as a path, not an url. But programmers sometimes are a bit loose on the terminology.

391,Overlaping Elements Css grid système,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
Bonjour,
Dans l’étape numéro 3 de cet exercice : https://www.codecademy.com/fr/courses/learn-css-grid/lessons/css-grid-ii/exercises/overlapping-elements?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi l’item “overlap” ne fonctionne pas uniquement sur l’item “right”, il n’y a aucun de Z-index spécifié mais il semble tout de même y avoir un ordre caché dur à comprendre !

Hello,
In step number 3 of this exercise:
I do not understand why the item “overlap” does not work only on the item “right”, there is no Z-index specified but it still seems to be a hidden order hard to understand!
This is not a French language course so you will need to communicate in English as best you can. I just used Google Translate.
","
Without a z-index, rendering follows normal flow… First the left, then the overlap, then the right.
    <section class=""left"">
      <h2>Left</h2>
    </section>
    <div class=""overlap"">
      <h3>Overlap!</h3>
    </div>
    <section class=""right"">
      <h2>Right</h2>
    </section>

If the order is changed in the source code,
    <section class=""left"">
      <h2>Left</h2>
    </section>
    <section class=""right"">
      <h2>Right</h2>
    </section>
    <div class=""overlap"">
      <h3>Overlap!</h3>
    </div>

Notice that now we can remove the z-index from the overlapping element and it still renders as expected. This is because it gets drawn on the screen last so is not partially concealed by the right element.
The order in which elements appear in the source code is the order in which they are drawn.

Is it possible to use the float property and the clear property for an element, displaying both? If so, how would it look like?
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/learn-css-display-positioning/lessons/css-display-positioning/exercises/css-clear

Simple answer: No. The clear property would need to apply to the parent container.
<div class=""parent-container"">
    <div class=""floated-container""></div>
    <div class=""floated-container""></div>
    <div class=""floated-container""></div>

The inner divs are floats, but to prevent any conflict with the normal flow (the containers that follow the parent) we need to clear the float property.
.parent-container {
    clear: left;
}
.floated-container {
    float: left;
}

394,<footer> container preventing horizontal display of lists?,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
New to web development/CSS and I feel like I have an understanding of CSS display and position rules, but still struggling to execute them…
I’ve been trying all morning to display 4 unordered lists horizontally across the bottom of my page in a footer.  I put each list in a  container with the same class ()and styled them-
.section{
         width: 25%;
         float: left;
}

I also had all 4 lists inside a <footer> element because i wanted to style a box that would surround all four lists at the bottom of the page.   I styled the footer-
footer {
        width: 100%
        display: inline-block;
}

I’ve been googling all morning and changing the codes, but the lists were still lining up vertically.  I deleted the footer tag all together from HTML and finally the lists displayed horizontally.  Would somebody mind explaining why?  Seeing the horizontal display finally alleviated some of my frustration, but I would still like to put these lists inside a parent element so I can style the area surrounding them.
Also, I remember reading in a textbook that since every element in my footer was a float, the footer would technically have no content and I’d have to add an ::after styling to create my box?

396,Border Color Question,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
While working on the box model portion of the Learn CSS course I noticed that I couldn’t pass a step if I didn’t declare the border color to be white even though the h1 element the border was wrapped around was already declared white. I’m curious if there is any benefit or reason for declaring both the h1 element and the border of that element to be white instead of saving time and letting the border inherit the color of the h1 element if I wanted them to both be the same color?
","

The Box Model

It’s true that border color is derived from the foreground color. The alternative is declare the style and width and let the color come from the foreground of the element it wraps…
  /*border: 3px solid white;*/
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 3px;

though some might find the shorthand declaration simpler to write and to read. Granted there is some reduncancy but it is a fair trade-off.

397,A few questions about CSS Grid,"Get Help,CSS",,5,"
I couldn’t find the course as a category on the forum, so I figured “positioning” is the closest thing.
I’m wondering about the use of CSS Grid. For one thing, do most browsers support it? The fact that I had to enable experimental web platforms on Chrome to use it makes me wary.
If a browser doesn’t support Grid, what happens to a page that uses it? Will it display incorrectly?
I’m also wondering why I would need to use it, particularly because it might not be fully supported yet. I taught myself HTML and CSS about a decade ago, so much of the courses here have been review for me. But I seem to remember being able to position elements both explicitly and implicitly using HTML and basic CSS without the “grid” property. Are those methods now obsolete, or am I remembering incorrectly? I could have sworn divs could be used as a grid.
Basically, does CSS Grid actually have functions that can’t be achieved another way, or is it just more convenient than doing it another way?
","

I think this (Experimental Platform features) and JavaScript Harmony are safe to enable at this time. Much of it has become de facto in current browsers.

 krazykikikat:

does CSS Grid actually have functions that can’t be achieved another way


Twitter Bootstrap is one such addon, among many others that have surfaced over the years. Only CSS Grid has been taken all the way to browser implementation, though. All the others require a plug-in (imported CSS). To manually perform what it can do is a very mammoth task requiring floats, absolute positioning, media queries, etc. which all take their toll on designers when it comes to responsive design. CSS Grid pushes all that stuff off the table and lets us work in a well defined document namespace.

Thanks, that makes sense! I’m glad CSS Grid is fully implemented. I can see that when developing a large site, Grid would be much easier to use than specifying positioning for each class or element.  For a one-page project, I’d probably prefer using absolute positioning and floating. But not many projects are single-page.

Multiple page sites usually only have a handful of layout variations. The key is to write templates that can work in many situations, and minimize the number of actual templates. The more consistency in the design and layout, the easier to maintain and update over time. It all starts from a single page that can be spawned to create new pages. Adapt the pages to that one design, and vary according to purpose, not just for the sake of varying.

399,"CSS Display and Positioning, Exercise 3","Get Help,CSS",,4,"
Hello!
In exercise 3 of CSS course there is a task to offset divs with ‘question’ class by 40px from the top to their relative position. There are total of 5 divs with that class, but I only notice the first one getting the offset while the others are unaffected. Shouldn’t each element with said class move accordingly?
Thanks in advance!
","
they all move down.
lets say we only add the top: 40px to the first question:
<!-- simple id to only target the first question -->
<div class=""question"" id=""question"">
    <h4>Question 1</h4>

/* css */
.question {
  text-align: center;
  position: relative; 
}
#question {
  top: 40px;
}

you will see overlap between bottom of question 1 and top of question2.
this is how position relative works, first all elements are placed on the webpage, and then they are pushed down 40px, which means the gap between the bottom of question 1 and the top of question 2 stays the same.

Thank you for clarification!

We’ve been learning about boxes but I can’t see any code relating to them in both the html and css files, why?  in Exercise 6 . Lesson: Display and Positioning
","
At the start of the course is a page that explains the box model that CSS follows. It relates to block level elements, that is any element with width, height and position properties, as well as margin, padding, border, top, left, bottom and right properties, among others.
The box model concerns itself with dimensions, normal flow and position. The boxes as such are containers such as <div>, <ul>, <table>, <p>, etc., all of which are blocks.
In CSS we have a property called, box-sizing which lets us specifiy whether the border and padding is in the content box or surrounding it. It’s probably the only property with the word box in it.

406,Auto - Box Model Explanation,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
Hello,
I am a complete newb at CSS and was wondering if I could have someone explain to me the Auto lesson the CSS Box Model principles. Could someone give me a run down in simple terms so as to finally get what the heck this Auto Centering stuff means?
","
auto refers to how the property would render if there was no rule at all in the custom style sheet. The browser is preloaded with its own style sheet. That’s how lists know to have padding and bullets, paragraphs know to have a blank line between consecutive paragraphs, table headings know to be centered and bold, etc.
margin: auto 1em;

In earlier iterations of CSS we would have to contain an element in a text-align: center; context before we could apply this rule to the target element.
body {
    font-size: 1em;
}
div {
    text-align: center;
}
div div {
    width: 50%;
    margin: auto 1em;
}

but in today’s browsers that has been addressed so the parent container no longer factors in. Set a width, and give it horizontal margin of auto and it will be self-centering in any width parent.

There are a number of properties that will take auto as the declared value. The best place to find them is W3C (w3.org)… Bear in mind when searching that w3schools has been aggressively SEOing and getting dominant placement in the SERPs, of late. Not a big fan of those guys, especially given we can source out the horse’s mouth.
%search_term% site:w3.org

or
%search_term% MDN

which has excellent interpretation of the documentation, and always has links to W3C
Given they’ve been around nearly 15 years and were the real mainstay proponents of the living standard,  (this group includes industry collaboration with Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft)…

There is a proviso… There may be ways to do this with less structure. That is a sort of experiment to embark upon when you have a weekend to spend reading and tinkering. I did the above because it was the fast and dirty way to accomplish the desired effect.

When i set an element to 100px width, it is actually around 150px. Something that i set as 500px becomes around 750px
What is the best way to verify if the pixels i set are applied? Thank you.

413,Conflicting css property resolve order,"Get Help,CSS",,2,"
So the id attribute has a higher hierarchy than the class attribute in CSS?
","
Take a look at the code:
<p class=""x"" id=""y"">color</p>
#y {
  color: red;
}
.x {
  color: blue;
}

what color do you think the paragraph will be?

red, the id is higher in hierachy

now, to prove that this is actually true, look at the following code:
<p>color</p>
p {
   color: red;
}
p {
   color: blue;
}

same question as before, what color will the paragraph be?

blue, if there is not difference in hierarchy between selectors, the last property is applied.

Above is a selector rule declaration.
Everything in CSS is a declaration. There is no logic.

but what does it mean in css to declare something and, thanks

A declaration is a statement that always applies, unconditionally. That’s why we call them rulesets.

sorry but i still dont understand

thank you, anyway mtf

“Today the Mayor declared it as CSS Appreciation Day.”
When we write a selector rule, everything inside the curly braces is a declaration.
/* everything below is a ruleset */
selector {
    property: value;    /* this is a declaration */
}    
/* everything is included in the declaration block {}


this helped and i went on and reviewed other sources a bit more, thanks

417,CSS Tag Order and Placement,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
When modifying an HTML document with CSS, is there a particular order that the tags should be arranged? For example, the font-family attribute should come before color, or text-size or any of the various options available? When changing a paragraph style, does the box content come before text attributes. It feels like a jumbled mess of font-size; text-transform; width; color; float; font-family;etc… Just curious if there is a reason or order.

 quxel:

is there a particular order that the tags should be arranged?


No. Any order will do.
selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

(Pretend the properties are all different.) Every declaration will apply to the selector in every instance within the document. The order the declarations are written has no bearing.
What is important is the order of the cascade (the order in which selector rules are written). That has a huge impact.

Save the above HTML as, ‘eg_1.html’ in a folder named, ‘selectors’ so other examples may be saved later.
Once you have saved it, launch it in a browser. Note how the style rules were applied. Avoid drawing any conclusions. There is more to this than can be expressed in black and white, even while it is declarative. We need to peel away the layers and form an idea of causes and effects.
What do we know?
Well, we know that a class selector has higher specificity (importance) than a type selector. But that does not explain why we have yellow text everywhere, and no red, not even in the class named element.
Why is the teal background only in the first segment, and none of the others?
I won’t attempt to get into the details, just yet, until you have reached this point and are ready to proceed further with examination of this, and subsequent examples.

[Edit]
If you have copied and saved the earlier code already, give it a new name, like ‘eg__1.html’ and copy/save the above revised code for a clearer demonstration. Nothing has changed in the general discussion.

Simplest would be to say we have three rows. What’s to add to that? Just because it works out mathmetically to one’s arbitrary needs does not mean it has a practical application. Now you have to work with six rows, when three is all you want.

@text decoration


@ is a metacharacter in CSS that shunts selector rule parsing along that path before reading the rest of the style sheet.
@import 'thispage.css'

The file will be read in and parsed before any other CSS in the containing file. Of course this is always the first line in the file; never later. But that has nothing really to do with the expected usage of text-decoration.
a {
    text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

is an example of typical usage.

div {

Because of built in margin collapse, the distant between div’s vertically will be 30px, not 60px. This is similar in nature to border-collapse on tables.

w3c still has the best explanation about when margins do and do not collapse:

Block elements default to width: auto when not declared in the ruleset. That means if the parent element is the full width of the window (which it is by default) then that element will also be the full width, also.

 vignaanvardhan:

no, its not. Because the bottom margin collapses. So the effective distance is 30px

which one should we consider the  space of element A or Element c?

this is literally explained within the lesson:
Unlike horizontal margins, vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical margins sets the distance between adjacent elements.
so if its element A or C depends on which has the larger margin. In this case, C has the larger margin, thus this will be the margin between the two elements.

Exercise 16 https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-typography/lessons/css-typography/exercises/font-face-i?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
Question: What is the reason for having the font added to CSS (Exercise 16) instead of directly onto HTML(Exercise 15)?
","
The document is not geared to presentation, but information and content. HTML is the core, the document structure that will dictate how the DOM tree is built. We give meaning and importance to page content by how we structure it. This has nothing to do with presentation.
External style sheets have re-usability as the primary asset. That and the fact that when the style rules work to our satisfaction for one page, they work for an hundred pages, or a thousand. One set of rules for an entire site.
And, the presentation is a separate concern from the pages to which the rules will apply. They are content based, and that is all.

Think about style sheets as determining how your page looks and the amount of work that would be required if you had a large site with style definitions embedded into the html on every page. If you wanted to change your paragraph style you would have to do it on every page. If you use a style sheet you only have to change it in that one place and your entire site will look different.

However it mentions that ""Once a font is linked, we can create CSS selectors to target elements.
Step 1 : When we have the link to the font of our choice, we can add the font to the  section of the HTML document, using the  tag and the href.

Step 2 : In HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is . The CSS syntax for selecting  elements is p{}. Hence, it would be p{font-family:Droid Serif;}
If i had wanted to change my paragraph styles i would only have to change it in that one place on the above CSS syntax. I still can’t tell where is the hassle of incorporating it directly onto HTML instead of CSS?

These exercises are very simplified compared to real world scenarios. Imagine a fairly typical case where you have a 1000+ html Web page, and over 100 style rules in css. Incorporating these all inline would be horrible to maintain and it wouldn’t be obvious what was happening.
Separating it into another css document gives a much clear sense of what is happening, makes it easier to change things and allows you to reuse styles across different parts of your website.
To give another example imagine the case where in 20 different places of your website you want to apply an underline, font colour change, background colour change and a certain font size. In pure HTML you would have to repeat these 4 rules in 20 different places, whereas in css you would just give these 20 places a single class and give that class the 4 rules in css.
Hope that clarifies it a little more.

Using of parents and child in css is one its advantage. its simply to change codes in a chile while you have the original codes in a parent, site will run as codes described in the child but the main codes already exist.

Incorporating the CSS font inline (one by one for each element) through HTML would be difficult to maintain. This i would totally agree.
""Separating it into another css document gives a much clear sense of what is happening, makes it easier to change things and allows you to reuse styles across different parts of your website""
However, what i’m confused is that notice this HTML method is not really incorporating the CSS font inline (one by one for each element) through HTML.
We would still have to create CSS selectors to target elements , so how does it make this more horrible to maintain than the other method ? Because what i’m seeing is that if we were to make any changes to the font style we could still do it directly on the css documents through their selectors, which is similar to the other method.
If we were to incorporate font through HTML
Step 1: HTML (add the font to the head section of the HTML document, using the  tag and the href )

Step 2: Create selectors in CSS and set fonts.

If we were to incorporate font through CSS directly
Step 1: CSS (copy the @font-face rules to the top of the CSS stylesheet for the font)

Step 2: Create selectors in CSS and set fonts.


Ah I see where the confusion is.
You are not adding the font “in html” in your Step 1 you are linking to an external CSS file which just so happens to only declare one thing a font. This line is no different to adding any other CSS file.
The difference between them is load time:

Typically everything in one file will be quicker as only one request has to be made for the file.
However with Google related links it can be quicker to separate them. For instance if you go on CC and they’ve already loaded the Google font from the link, next time you go a website that requires that font your browser will already have the font so a request never has to be sent externally.

Hope that’s a little clearer

Typically everything in one file will be quicker…
So i understand that the load time will be quicker if we had copied the @font-face rules to the top of the CSS stylesheet for the font, instead of linking an external CSS file onto the HTML document.
as only one request has to be made for the file
Only one request has to be made if we were to incorporate font through CSS directly, in other words for the linking of external CSS file onto the HTML document, more than one request has to be made. Could you assist to shed more light on this?

So your browser works by requesting all linked files on a webpage.
If there is a CSS file and an external link to a CSS font file, then there are two requests to load these two separate files. If it was all in one only one request has to be made.

433,CSS font size,"Get Help,CSS",,4,"
What is the standard font size for in pixels.
","
There is no real standard, as such, but out of the box a browser will render the default size set on the user’s device. On a desktop and laptop it will be ~16px for a capital X (unless the user has changed it).
As a general rule, I always start with the body having a font size of 100% so that the user’s preferred size is adopted as the base. After that I use em's so proportion is maintained.
If not zoomed in or out, the font size of this text is 14px set by the site style sheet.

Extra Study
Be sure to do lots of experimenting with raw html sprinkled with CSS for effect. To be really effective at CSS design we need to know not just how to do things, but what happens when we do things.
CSS is entirely declarative. There is no logic, only design and purpose. Learn all the default styles of every HTML element when a page has no style sheet of its own.
Here is an example of raw testing…
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>

435,Min/Max-Width,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
Hi.
I’m a little confused by this statement I found in this article. The statement is: ""The max-width property overrides the width property, but min-width will always override max-width whether followed before or after width in your declaration. ""
In the code example, they have
.wrapper {
  min-width: 50em; /* Overrides max-width */
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 20em; /* Will be AT MOST 20em wide */
}

Is the article saying that min-width is always going to override max-width assuming that min-width is set to a larger value? It doesn’t appear to specifically say that, but otherwise what would be the purpose of using min-width and max-width together?
Thanks!
Phoenix
","
I tested it a bit. min-width does override max-width if min-width is greater. So I think precedence goes: min-width beats max-width beats width
The only reason to use min-width and max-width would be to make sure an element stays within a certain range, such that min-width < width < max-width
There would never be a reason to to use a greater min-width than max-width. You could just make max-width equal to the min-width and achieve the same effect.

That clears it up!
Thanks!

436,CSS Lesson six - h1 selector - won't accept 'maroon',"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
The instructions read: Inside the curly braces of the h1 selector you just declared, write:

This code will make the text color of all h1 tags maroon.
This is what I wrote, but it won’t pass and I can’t move on from the lesson. I am using the Chrome browser:
h1	{

}
The error message is insisting that I did not type in ‘maroon’. How can I move on from this lesson?

Can you post all the CSS you’ve got in the editor?
That selector looks OK to me, but we can check the rest of your CSS just in case.

so what do i do?

you can use format your code, then it should be fine. Just copy paste your code, select the whole code and press the </> button (just above where you are typing) or ctrl + shift + c. Then it should be fine
or dump your code on a site like jsbin, jsfiddle or codepen

i put your code here:

the images won’t load obviously, but twitch seems to float right? Its certainly on the right hand side:

Screenshot_2018-05-29_16-41-50.png1327×239 924 Bytes

i see 4 images on right hand side.

Yes, i understand. But i want the four small fotos in the .twitch class to be all the way to the right. So it doesnt touch the banner img


thisIsHowIWantIt.jpg1919×1041 992 KB


then i would go for a 3 column layout as discussed here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20566660/3-column-layout-html-css

Oke, thanks.
But i dont understand.
Isn’t this the same way i did it?
class=“header” == class=“container”
class=“nav-content” == class=“column-left”
class=“banner” == class=“column-center”
class=“twitch” == class=“column-right”

ah, that explains a lot, flex and float do not work together:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39194630/float-does-not-work-in-a-flex-container
either use flex, or float. A mixture of both isn’t going to work properly. Then i would go for flex, but then go flex all the way

Oke thanks for the tip.
So how do i use flex to make it go all the way to the right?

no idea. I think with flex you simple get three columns, just make the outer right one very small and the middle one large. The alternative is to use float: left for the left and middle column, and then float: right for the right column.

Thanks for the help so far.
But now i have a new question, i took away the display: flex; and now the .twitch is forced down below the height of the .header div.
And there is a margin att max width on .twitch for some reason, wich i can’t remove. Any ideas?

if you want to use float: right to float beside another element, that element should have float: left
i covered that here:



 stetim94:

The alternative is to use float: left for the left and middle column, and then float: right for the right column.

Take a closer look at the grid-template definition in your .grid selector.
Do you still think the grid should be 4x4?

Hi there,
By using 1fr 1fr 1fr, each rows/child element will take one-third space of the width of the parent element .grid.
Each row will have the width of 400/3px;

Why doesn’t 2fr 2fr 2fr work?


There are not six rows but three. 1fr makes logical sense, so would be the one to use (and it is what the lesson checker expects, according to the message).

By using 2fr 2fr 2fr each row/child element will take up two-sixth space of the width of the parent element.
Each row will have the width of [(400/6) x 2], which again gives us the same results, hence my initial question.

Hi,
Note that there are three rows, not six

Why would we do that? Don’t get me wrong, we do help people. But definitions of things already exist. Why not check documentation for the definitions? MDN has good documentation on html, css and JS.

I had checked MDN and W3schools, but they are quite hard to understand.
It would be good if you tell me the difference between these terms.

for example justify-content:
The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of their container.
so this indicates the spacing around the elements of your grid. There are even plenty of examples on MDN to see it in action?

442,Q on CSS Course - Font-Face III,"Get Help,CSS",,3,"
I’m having some trouble with Font-Face III on the Learn CSS course (Typography section).
I’m supposed to pull a font (Glegoo) from the fonts/ directory and create a selector in style.css using the @font-face property.
First - where can I access the fonts/ directory? Is it something within CodeAcademy? I think I’m just missing it.
Second - here’s the instructions I’m having trouble with: “Within the @font-face rule, add a src attribute with the relative path of the file Glegoo-Regular.ttf and a format of truetype. Make sure to include this path in the url() parentheses.”
Right now this is what I have:
@font-face {
font-family: ‘Glegoo’;
src: url(“relative-path”) format(’…/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf’);
}
Originally when I clicked “Hint” it said the relative path for Glegoo-Regular.tff is “…/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf” so that’s what I had in “relative-path” - but then when I clicked Run and it was wrong, it said: Did you add a ‘…/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf’ value to the format value? So I moved the “…/fonts/Gelgoo…” to format instead.
Help! What am I doing wrong? And any other articles/videos/input as to understanding Font-Face would be great too. I understand linking Google Fonts but can’t wrap my head around this one.

You can see the fonts/ directory by clicking the Folder icon to the left of the style.css and index.html tabs at the top center of the page.



 marieluna992:

Second - here’s the instructions I’m having trouble with: “Within the @font-face rule, add a src attribute with the relative path of the file Glegoo-Regular.ttf and a format of truetype. Make sure to include this path in the url() parentheses.”
Right now this is what I have:
@font-face {
font-family: ‘Glegoo’;
src: url(“relative-path”) format(’…/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf’);
}


I think you it will make more sense and be easier to solve once you see the folder structure. The solution is:
@font-face {
    font-family: ""Glegoo"";
    src: url(../fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf) format('truetype');
}

You are writing into the style.css which in the project folder is in styles/style.css so for that file to see fonts you go up a folder (…) then to fonts/Glegoo…)

Sorry guys i know this is the wrong topic for discussion, however i am not getting any response from the other 2 forums that i had posted this question to:
(1) Learn HTML & CSS Part 1: 11. CSS Positioning
Learn CSS: Grid (CSS Grid Essentials)
(2) CSS: An Overview
Learn CSS: Grid (CSS Grid Essentials)
Hope someone out there could enlighten me on this , i have an enquiry regarding Exercise 6 of Learn CSS: Grid (CSS Grid Essentials)
I would appreciate your help alot.
Here is the link : https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-grid/lessons/css-grid-i/exercises/fraction?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
Instructions
Change your rows so that each row will take up the exact same fraction of the available space.
Question1: Why doesn’t 2fr 2fr 2fr work? Doesn’t it produce the same results as 1fr 1fr 1fr?

If it is not expected by the SCT, it will not be accepted, regardless that it works as expected. In the present instance, there are only three rows, not six so it makes sense to use 1fr rather than 2fr.

It seems like you are the only person around here in CodeAcademy !

What’s the difference between a class such as …class=“publish-time” and …class= “green bold”?
Why when creating the CSS selector,  the “publish-time” can be used as one selector and the “green bold” creates two separate selectors?

 sergioa06:

class=“publish-time” and …class= “green bold”?


publish-time is a single class name, whereas green bold are co-classes that both apply.

Hello,
My CSS isn’t linking to my HTML file. All files are in the same folder {Name}Portfolio. The folder includes stylesheet.css, about.html, index.html, and contact.html. As a test I was just trying to update the header color using the code
h1{color: [insert color]}
but it isn’t updating.
On each html file in the head section i have the following code
<link href=""stylesheets.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

","
my link code isn’t showing up but its 

yeah the link is correct. what you should make sure is correct is the page name of the stylesheet, how it is being saved ___.css

dont forget to add the link in the  HEAD tag

How are you spelling stylesheet i.e. the name of the file? You spelled it two different ways in your post.

Hello Everyone,
Thank you for the help! It’s resolved now.

Quick Tips for Writing Good Posts
what information to provide (code and exercise url)

Hello
I appreciate your immediate response. Yes, I did read other existing post with regards to my concern but was not satisfied with the answer and it did not help me at all. I’m not sure if it’s about the compatibility of computer/laptop or software that was installed on mine.
I’m currently working on the last activity - Lesson 26 Links and Text Decoration (Review). The instructions were as follows:

Add a link to your HTML page using Link text tags (check the Hint if you need a
reminder). You can link to any webpage.
On the CSS tab, change your link’s text-decoration to none and its color to #cc0000.

Everything was properly encoded. Checking the previous lessons  to make sure the codes are accurate. I did adjust the zoom of my screen (+ or -) but it didn’t work as well. I also tried refreshing the page and re-encoding but end up having the same results.
Error Message: Oops, try again. Did you remember to set your link’s text-decoration to none;?
Thanks

i don’t care about the instructions, i want to see what you coded, and the exercise url so i can access the exercise and debug within the exercise.

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	    <link type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheet.css""/>

Let me know…If you were able to view my codes

Try text-decoration: none; (notice space after colon), the exercise validation is precise.

that is the old course, its longer supported. I highly recommend upgrading to the supported courses:

I did. Space or without space. It doesn’t work

Good day guys , i have an enquiry regarding Exercise 14 of Learn CSS: Typography.
I would appreciate your help alot.
Here is the link : https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-typography/lessons/css-typography/exercises/linking-fonts-i?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-css
Instructions
Linking Fonts I
With the number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to expect users to have all fonts installed on their computers. New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts.
Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use. Google Fonts gives us a way to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style properties.
We’ll show you where to add this link in the next exercise.
Question1: I am aware of the procedure to retrieve the necessary links, however my question is how are we suppose to know which are the fonts that users already have installed on their computers? To be on the safe side, is it possible to assume that some users may not have the more older and basic fonts (such as Garamond) installed on their computers?
","
The installed fonts should be listed for each operating system, so do a search and see what surfaces. Garamond has been available since Windows 98, if I’m not mistaken.
Another consideration is whether the user has Office or Word, which installs more fonts on top of the OOB fonts that come with the OS.
Fallback fonts can be Arial & Helvetica, for sans-serif, Times, for serif, ‘Comic Sans MS’ or perhaps ‘Lucida Handwriting’, for cursive, Impact for fantasy. and ‘Courier New’ for monspace.

Late addendum: The generic family name is always notwithstanding. That goes without saying.

Thanks for the revert! Did a little research into it and here is what i found:
According to WIKI
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (13.23%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.57%).
In the mobile (smartphone and tablet combined) sector, use in 2017 is up to 70% of Google’s Android and according to third quarter 2016 data, Android on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent and a growth rate 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple’s iOS with 12.1 percent and a per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.
October 2017 worldwide webbrowsing share
Place	Mobile system	  Desktop system
1	       Android (73%)          Windows (83%)
2	       iOS (20%)                 OS X (13%)
3	       Nokia (1%)                 Linux (2%)
4	       Windows (1%)          Chrome OS (1%)

1.Windows : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Microsoft_Windows
2.OS X : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_macOS
Will continue to research more into this , thanks 

Actually i didn’t quite get you there, do you mind to elaborate further? Referring to this “The generic family name is always notwithstanding”

No matter how far back we go in attempting to cater to all systems, there is always a chance we might find an outlier. For that, generic family names are the only fallback.
Times, serif
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
Courier, monospace
""Comic Sans MS"", cursive
Impact, fantasy

These would be the tail end of a font-family property value option list, always ended by the generic family name.

Got it, just to check will all my posts and replies from fellow code campers be saved under the “Activity” tab? Or will they be automatically deleted after a period of time?

Nothing is automatically deleted, just closed for further discussion to keep old topic threads from being bumped to the top by passers by.
The only thing that is deleted periodically are posts or topics that offer little of value to the consuming public; things that we don’t need coming up in search results.

If a topic of your own, or one of some importance needs to be reopened with new evidence or matter for discussion, any moderator can reopen it upon request.

Is there anyway to know if any of my posts or codecamper’s reply had been deleted on purpose or by accident by the moderator? Just worried as down the road i would like to revise back on the questions i have had. If i can’t remember which particular topic/thread had been deleted, i will not be able to even make the reopen request to the moderator

This is far more than one can elaborate on. Nobody keeps track of these things. You are left to monitor your own posts.



 amandaloh:

i will not be able to even make the reopen request to the moderator


Not wiithout a post URL, no. Closed posts are still litsted so if you have the topic in front of you but it is closed, you have the URL that needs to be opened. That’s where mods come in.

Good day mtf, i was looking through the installed fonts that came with Microsoft Windows XP and according to Wikepedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Microsoft_Windows , the first Windows version for the font Aharoni is Windows 10.
I did a crosschecked against Microsoft page itself and noticed that it had already appeared since Windows 2000.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/index
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/aharoni
Is this an error on wiki, or am i missing something here?

That is well beyond my ability to answer, hence the vagueness of my earlier relply.

Bumpz is anyone out there able to help on this?




 amandaloh:

I did a crosschecked against Microsoft page itself and noticed that it had already appeared since Windows 2000.


Windows 2000 was an enterprise version that replaced Windows NT, also an enterprise version, neither one of which would be in the hands of everyday consumers. We cannot assume that any fonts it came bundled with were available in consumer OS versions. As mentioned earlier, MS typically bundled specialty fonts with Office to spread the licensing cost across multiple products. Fonts cost money, and in order to keep the cost of the operating within reason, MS opted to limit the number offered.
The main thing is that you can declare any fonts you like just so long as you also consider suitable substitutes, in order of preference and end your list with the core font and generic family.

That’s a good enough answer for me, thanks mtf!

Remember to enclose your value inside your property, hint: property: value;

that didn’t change a thing in how it responds. its still says the same issue. I continued to another lesson. and the same thing happend.

The same thing is happening to me too. It always says change the decorations to none.

It seems like there’s something wrong with whatever code checks the “text-decoration” part; I skipped that lesson when it gave me the error and on another lesson the same message appears.
EDIT: It’s the “text-decoration” code in general. I went on to CSS Selectors #7 now and it incorrectly states that
“It looks like you accidentally removed the text-decoration from the link outside the unordered list.”

Yea I got to that part too and it happened, at least for me it still marked the course as complete.

This is happening to me too, please help!

With everybody saying it’s not working, it is most likely a bug in the tests checking if the lesson is correct, request moving this to bugs instead.

you miss a semi-colon after none, you could try that
@thinkverse, i think reporting a bug won’t do much good. Its the old learning environment, which is no longer supported.  So its highly recommend to update to the more recent supported course:
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css

it didn’t work
it is a bug

Just because i make a suggestion for someone doesn’t mean it works for you too, you might have a different problem. Doesn’t mean its automatically bugged

it happen to me.
it is like a bug.
the chromebook i have will say it




 hitoyou:

it is like a bug.


it could indeed be a different bug in your code. Although the course is no longer maintained, i checked, this exercise is still working. Just saying its a bug, i can’t help you.
