1,Understanding jQuery function - Comment box,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
Hi guys
We are making a comment box using jquery, but we don’t quite understand the the code in detail. Can anyone of you please help us? I have marked what we find most difficult in bold.
I’m sorry that the code is so long, but I figured that it would be easier to get the connection and understand the code.

/* JQuery used for comment box functions
document ready function - Jquery detects that the page status is ready
code will ony run once page is ready for javascript code to execute
Jquery is a javascript library - simplifies the language and event handling
*/
class CommentBox{
constructor(username, comment){
this.username = username;
this.comment = comment;
}
}
// The preventDefault will prevent the default event from occuring. The preventDefault shares similar features to the return false in JavaScript
(document).ready(function(){
    ("".editor-header a"").click(function(e){
e.preventDefault();
**// We create a dialog box. **
var _val = (this).data(""role""),**
**_sizeValIn = parseInt((this).data(“size-val”) + 1),
_sizeValRe = parseInt((this).data(""size-val"") - 1),**
**_size = (this).data(“size”);
if(_size == “in-size”){
document.execCommand(_val, false, _sizeValIn + “px”);
} else{
document.execCommand(_val, false, _sizeValRe + “px”);
}
});
});
// Universal function to retrieve user Array from LocalStorage
var activeUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(‘activeUser’))
var username = activeUser.username
// Define comment
if(localStorage.getItem(‘comments’) == null) {
var comments = ;
} else {
var comments = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(‘comments’));
}
// below - pulls in html div’s - clarify how
$(document).ready(function(){
var text = (""#text""),
submit = (“input[type=‘submit’]”),
listComment = ("".listComments""),
loading = ("".loading""),
_data,
totalCom = ("".total-comment"");
$totalCom.text($("".listComments > div"").length);

$($submit).click(function(){
if($text.html() == “”){
alert(“Please write a comment!”);
$text.focus();
} else{
_data = $text.html();
return false;
}

});
});
$(document).ready(function(){
var text = (""#text""),
submit = (“input[type=‘submit’]”),
listComment = ("".listComments""),
loading = ("".loading""),
_data,
totalCom = ("".total-comment"");
totalCom.text(("".listComments > div"").length);
$($submit).click(function() {
  if ($text.html() == """") {
  
  $text.focus();
} else {
  _data = $text.html();
  comment = _data;

comment = new CommentBox(username, comment);
comments.push(comment);
localStorage.setItem(‘comments’, JSON.stringify(comments));
$loading.show().fadeOut(300);
$listComment.append("""" + _data + “”);
$text.html("""");
totalCom.text(("".listComments > div"").length);
return false;
}
// Show activeUsers previous comments on mainpage
});
var allcomments = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(‘comments’));
var user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(‘activeUser’));
for(i=0; i < allcomments.length; i++){
if(user.username == allcomments[i].username) {
var listComment = ("".listComments"")
$loading.show().fadeOut(300);
$listComment.append("""" + allcomments[i].comment + “”);
$text.html("""");
}
}
});

To be honest, i also did not know about the details of this code. In fact, these terms are quite new to me. And students can get help from edubirdie reviews to write their task easily. So, if any one knows about this term then do share it with me also. I will be very thankful to you.

2,Feedster,"Get Help,jQuery",,4,"
Can someone tell me why my menu disappears almost instantly when i move my mouse (ie. how do i change my code to ensure that it’s clickable): also here is the project link (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/projects/feedster?action=resume_content_item)
(document).ready(() => {
	(’.menu’).on(‘mouseenter’, () => {
('.nav-menu').show()
  })
  (’.menu’).on(‘mouseleave’, () => {
('.nav-menu').hide()
  })
  (’.btn’).on(‘mouseenter’, event => {
(event.currentTarget).addClass('.btn-hover')
  }).on('mouseenter', event => {
    (event.currentTarget).removeClass(’.btn-hover’)
})
('.postText').on('keyup', event => {
    let post = (event.currentTarget).val();
let remaining = 140 - post.length;
$(’.characters’).html(remaining);
if (remaining <= 0) {
  $('.wordcount').addClass('red')
} else {
   $('.wordcount').removeClass('red')
}

})
$(’.postText’).focus();
});
","
This code doesn’t look right.
Lets start by formatting your code correctly and adding a few $s!
$(document).ready(() =&gt; {
  $(’.menu’).on(‘mouseenter’, () =&gt; {
    $('.nav-menu').show()
  })
  $(’.menu’).on(‘mouseleave’, () =&gt; {
    $('.nav-menu').hide()
  })
  $(’.btn’).on(‘mouseenter’, event =&gt; {
    $(event.currentTarget).addClass('.btn-hover');
  });
  $(’.btn’).on('mouseenter', event =&gt; {
    $(event.currentTarget).removeClass(’.btn-hover’);
  });
  $('.postText').on('keyup', event =&gt; {
    let post = (event.currentTarget).val();
    let remaining = 140 - post.length;
    $(’.characters’).html(remaining);
    if (remaining <= 0) {
      $('.wordcount').addClass('red')
    } else {
       $('.wordcount').removeClass('red')
    }
  })
  $(’.postText’).focus();
});

I’ve added a few $s. You should also always end your statements with ;.
Next, near the beginning of the code, Jquery selects the class ‘menu’ and says on (when this happens) ‘mouseenter’ (the mouse enters the element - the ‘menu’ text). So if you want to show the nav-menu class on click, you will need to change mouseenter to click.
But if you change both mouseenter and mouseleave to click, each time you click on .menu, .nav-menu will show and then immediately hide. So you will need to remove the on mouseleave block ($(’.menu’).on(‘mouseleave’, () =&gt; { $('.nav-menu').hide() })) and change mouseenter to click. Then, in your new click block, you will need to check if it is currently visible or hidden. (Can you figure out how to do this?  )  Then, if it is currently hidden, show it, and if it’s shown, hide it.

i also use $(post).focus();

Can someone tell what is wrong here :
$(document).ready(() => {
$(’.menu’).on(‘mouseenter’, () => {
$('.nav-menu').show(""slow"")

});
$(’.menu’).on(‘mouseleave’, () => {
$('.nav-menu').hide(100)

});
$(’.btn’).on(‘mouseenter’, event => {
$(event.currentTarget).addClass('.btn-hover').on('mouseleave', event => {

$(event.currentTarget).removeClass('.btn-hover');

});
});
$(’.postText’).on(‘keyup’, event => {
let post = $(event.currentTarget).val();
let remaining = 140 - post.lenght;
if(remaining<=0) {
 $('.wordcount').addClass('.red');

} else {
 $('.wordcount').removeClass('.red');

}
$(’.characters’).html(remaining);
});
$(’.postText’).focus();
});
I’ve gone over the code step by step with the video tutorial and it still doesn’t work. The part with remaining characters is somehow wrong, but I don’t see it.
When I start typing the text in the message box, the number of characters disappears and it doesn’t turn red when the number of characters goes over 140.

Hello, @micro7894594922.
Welcome to the forums.
I don’t see anything in your HTML that would display a table. I copied your code into codepen.io, and it rendered:

which is what I expected.




 micro7894594922:



Hello Midlinder,
Thanks for your reply. Ok I added the following script from a Jquery library and it should display a table right?

JQuery.JPG716×401 23 KB


Are you expecting a table to be displayed in the browser’s developer tools pane or as part of the rendered page? Merely linking the jquery file in a <script></script> tag will not render anything to the page. It gives you access to the tools available in the jquery library.

Midlinder,
Thanks again for the reply and clarifying what linking the jquery file in a  tag won’t do. I was expecting the table to be apart of the rendered page.

what do you mean by table? Html has a <table> element, but i don’t think that is what you mean
what you show in the screenshot is the developers tool, is there something you expect to see there?

stetim94,
Thanks for the reply. I expected to see the developers tool on the browser. The instructor at school had us copy him and copy a jquery link to the html page, update and run it. This I was told would allow us to see developer tool at the bottom of the page as a result.

In the developers tool, you are currently in the network tab. There you can see the jquery file is fetched. If you switch to the elements tab, you should be able to see the <script> element in the html code

I’m using Chrome as the browser to run my html code and I don’t see a network tab. Should I change browsers to see the network tab/element tab? How do I switch to the elements tab? Once I see the script element in the html code and use it  will it  or will it not get me the developer tool in screenshot. Sorry for this as I’m new to HTML/CSS and Jquery.




 micro7894594922:

I’m using Chrome as the browser to run my html code and I don’t see a network tab.


how not? That that is the current active tab in your developer tools.



 micro7894594922:

you highlighted that tab in your in screenshot:

The screenshot is what the instructor had on his screen. I didn’t create the same result with my laptop. I just took at picture of what he had.

Check out this link: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open
It will give you several ways to open the developer tools in the chrome browser.

Thank you very much.

6,jQuery issue,"Get Help,jQuery",general,3,"
beginning to learn jQuery and finally got to my first hiccup while testing my skills. So I want to add some interactivity to my web page by allowing the user to put text on the web page. I try this by using an input, paragraph, and button elements. I attempted to make this function work so that when they click the button element that the text inside the input would replace the text inside the paragraph, but this does not work for some reason. Any help would be appreciated.
html
<p class=""interactive""> sample text</p>
<input type=""text"" class=""inputText"">
<button class= ""changeText"">input text</button>

jQuery
let inputText = document.getElementsByClassName('inputText').textContent;

$('.changeText').click(function(){
$('.interactive').text(inputText);

})

solved it. this is what I did with my jQuery.
$('.changeText').click(function(){

const inputText = $("".inputText"").val()

const interactive = $('.interactive').text(inputText);

})

Hi there, I completed this project, but unsure why my code is not displaying the desired output. Would be grateful if someone could please assist me
Link to project: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/projects/font-preview?action=resume_content_item
Here is my code:

   (’.preview’).css({

 ashibhat95:

(’#text’)


First, I think it should be (""#text"")  with single or double quotes instead of these backstics (used improerly also in + ‘px’).
Second, You must forgot about Dolla sign in a few spots.
Third,



 ashibhat95:

‘keyup’


Should be event with no quotes as first parameter, and then callback function as second parameter instead.
Also, replace .on() methods with diffrent methods.
Well, apparently You made the same mistake to all of Your .on() methods, as I can see.
Fourth, You closed rest of code inside first method parentheses, which is improper and then, You closed rest of code inside first callback function, which is improper too. Move last line })  on the next line after .val())
Fifth,



 ashibhat95:

(’#size’)


and



 ashibhat95:

(’#weight’)


should be (’#font-size’) and (’#font-weight’) instead. Pay attention to normal quotes instead of these weird backstics.
PS. Allways make sure to close all { }  ( ) and , ; properly. All coders know how annoying is to look into code for an hour just to find out missing character 
Also its a good habbit to keep spacing when nesting one thing inside other, press TAB or two spaces lets say. JS and jQuerry are forgiving for this in fact, so they will understand it regardless of ammount of whitespaces, but thats helps you and other programmers to read and find errors much easier.
I might be wrong myself as I am beginnier, it is just what I think so feel free to correct me if i am wrong. There also may be some other problems that i am not spotted yet.

I was wrong with some stuff in earlier comment. Now my code is correct:

$(document).ready(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', event => {
    $('.preview').html($(event.currentTarget).val());
  });
  
  $('#font').on('change', event => {
    $('.preview').css('fontFamily', $(event.currentTarget).val());
  });
  
  $('#weight').on('change', event => {
    $('.preview').css('fontWeight', $(event.currentTarget).val());
  });
  
  $('#size').on('keyup', event => {
    var fontSize = ($(event.currentTarget).val()) + 'px';
    $('.preview').css('fontSize', fontSize);
  });
  
})

9,Should I learn jQuery or react.js?,"Get Help,jQuery",,6,"
Which one should I learn. I’ve heard they both have practically the same uses.
","
Learn react.js . jQuery is slowly dying I think.

Ok! Thanks for the answer! I’ll learn react.js then.

Hello! You should just learn react.js instead.



Should I learn both JavaScript and CSS?


Jquery is declining in popularity because of several reasons (it was designed to solve a problem which no longer exist (cross browser support), which now happens in JS itself). Fetch and axios are popular alternatives for making asynchronous request.
for extensive DOM manipulation better libraries/frameworks now exist (vueJS, reactJS)


I hope this helps =)

Thanks also for your help too!

Always pick the right tool for the job. Jquery and reactJS aren’t quite that similar, reactJS is great for single page applications (SPA) while if your DOM manipulation is minimal, reactJS is overkill and you should just consider jquery/vanilla JS.

11,Event Handlers,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
Hi, so i finished the event handlers lesson on jQuery where we use the .on() method to create an event handler object. at the end of the lesson the task is to create a command for an onclick event to show an element on the HTML page. i was trying to come up with a simple way of reversing this method and came up with:
if ($navDropdown.show() = true;) {
$menuButton.on(‘click’, () => {
$navDropdown.hide().
});
does this not work because .show() does not evaluate to true or false? How would one make a simple command for resetting the element to being hidden, thanks for all help given

The code you’re looking for hasn’t been covered in the course at this point. This would work:
if ($navDropdown.is("":visible"")) {
  $navDropdown.hide();
} else {
  $navDropdown.show();
}

The above code is similar to what you were trying to do, but soon you will come across the toggle() method which makes this much simpler. Happy coding!

First, all three examples have the same jQuery object in context. We can stipulate to that.
The first is okay as long as it doesn’t use $(this) or this.
The second is fine all around until we get to the third.  That is the ideal way to write a callback function. A standalone, pure function that always gives a predictible response. x in, y out.
Or, click => response, that being the case.
Arrow functons are okay in callbacks as long as you use the event.target object for context, or the literal, eg., $('.nav-menu').

14,$(this) in jQuery for mouseleave event,"Get Help,jQuery",,7,"
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/lessons/mouse-events/exercises/on-mouseleave
In context to the question in the lesson whose link has been given:
I tried

('.nav-menu').on('mouseleave', () => {    (this).hide(); });

instead of

  $('.nav-menu').on('mouseleave', () => { $('.nav-menu').hide(); });

Can anyone help me in understanding what is the mistake here? Why cannot I use ‘this’ variable here? Also, there is also only a single ‘div’ element with class nav-menu in the index.html.
In the first code, there is Dollar sign in front of (’.nav-menu) and (this). But I don’t know why it’s not visible in the preview.
Maybe that can also be a question  , why some of the dollar signs are invisible in the preview. Maybe because they are used in the markup for some different purpose and here we are using HTML in the preview.
","
You can’t use this with arrow function syntax. If you do it this way, it works:
  $('.nav-menu').on('mouseleave', function() {
    $(this).slideUp(800); //I prefer the .slideUp to .hide
  });

Hope this helps! Happy Coding!

You can read this for more information on this and arrow functions (no pun intended ):



MDN Web Docs



Arrow functions
An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function...







About the dollar sign and its significance…
$()

is an alias for jQuery(); that is, both call the same function. The dollar sign is for convenience (less typing).
We invoke jQuery on an element node to create a jQuery object. Once created it will remain in memory with the variable reference we assign the object to.
$p = $('p')

The above has cached a collection of all the P-nodes (paragraph elements) in the HTML document. The dollar sign on the variable is meaningless to the program and is written to tell a reader that it is a jQuery object. Beyond that it is not required.

Thanks a lot, @midlindner  and @mtf 
I have a somewhat similar doubt in callback functions, it would be great if you could help me there also.
I think it is also in relation to the use of ‘this’ variable as mentioned in this post.

A callback is a function from which you expect a response before moving further. That response will be the argument in the pending function call.
We can defer function calls by assigning only the function reference to an event handler, such as, .on(), or an iterator such as, .each(). Note that these are both functions that accept other functions as their arguments.

PS:
Here is the link to the doubt post about which I was talking:

15,Is it neccessarry to store jQuery objects as constant?,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/lessons/jquery-setup/exercises/jquery-objects
Instead of ;
const navDropdown = (’#nav-dropdown’);
$navDropdown.hide();
Can we use ;
var navDropdown = (’#nav-dropdown’);
$navDropdown.hide();
If yes, what is the benefit of storing the object as const?
PS: I tried it and it was running fine with var in place of const
","
The only thing that is necessary is that our variables are locally scoped. We can use, const, let or var for this purpose. Which we use is inconsequential.
const prevents variables from being reassigned. If they are primitive values, like a number or string, etc. Their values are fixed and cannot be altered. If they are an array or object then the data type is fixed but we can still manipulate the values and items.
Above, navDropdown is (or rather should be) assigned a jQuery object.
const $navDropdown = $('#nav-dropdown');

There is no chance that this will be changed during the session since it is a cached element node which will not change. Mind, dynamically more child nodes could be added by the program, but that won’t change the identity of the cached node itself. const just prevents our program from reassigning the variable a new node.

16,Use JQuery Event handler to display JSON data,"Get Help,jQuery",,8,"
Hello!
I followed an online tutorial to use a JQuery event handler click event to initiate an alert() to show hard coded data. I was able to get it to work. However, I need to use it to display job descriptions that I have pulled in  via JSON. I am using HTML cards that contain the job title, company name, etc. I cannot get my button to show up on the card no matter what I try. Instead my button is at the very bottom and not contained inside the cards. What am I missing?
Also, why is nothing happening when I click on my button? When you click on the button, I want it to show the job description. All of this data is supplied via an API and in JSON format. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks!! Here is my codepen:
https://codepen.io/CodeDuchess/pen/jRRvgy
","
First, it looks like you need to add code to your JavaScript file to include a button with the elements that are appended to your cards. Something like:
const btn = document.createElement('BUTTON');
 btn.innerHTML = ""Click Me"";

card.appendChild(btn);

Those appended buttons will need to have your onclick function attached to them rather than the button rendered by your html (which you probably don’t need). You may want to give the buttons a class. You won’t be able to assign the same id to more than 1 button.
Hopefully this helps. Good luck with your project!

I was typing out button instead of btn – didn’t even think of that possibility. Your solution worked! Thank you so much! Have a great day!

You’re welcome. The const variable btn could just as easily be button or balogna or anything you like, as long as you continue to refer to it by the same name. 

Since you are generating each card, just append a button child to the card.
If you install the listener on card, a click on the button will bubble up and take the context of that card. There is your event target.

Dear mtf, Thank you!

Played around a little with the framework, and a tiny bit with the script.
    const btn = document.createElement('button');
    btn.textContent = ""Click Me"";  
       
    const p = document.createElement('p');
    p.textContent = `${job.description.substring(0, 300)}...`; 

Removed the whole ‘card’ div from the HTML…

On top of the website is a header with 2 inputs and a submit button. After you type exercise and group the exercise gonna be added to this group. Groups are made out of divs, exercises are li of ul that are siblings to those divs. I created an event handler with a function called exerciseRemove that is changing the background color of clicked exercise and changing the submit image from + into -. The event was working fine, but only for static li that were already on page but not on those added dynamically by js. I read that the way to do it with the others too i need to target the parent in jquery and add the actual target in a selector. So I changed the the code from

$(’.exercise-li’).on(‘click’,  exerciseRemover);

into

$(’.exercise-ul’).on(‘click’, ‘.exercise-li’,  exerciseRemover);

The event seems to be happening on all li now, however I have no idea what is actually going on. After click all the li from the ul seems to disappear and in front I see the first li from the ul with much smaller width and some red square behind it (the clicked li should change the background into red). With this event it happens on all li (those added dynamically and static that were already on page). To be clear with the first it works fine but just on those static.
I have also a second question but  regarding to CSS. The groups made out of divs and exercises made out of li have exactly same styling except background-color. However the exercises have smaller width (both of them are set to 60%). Is it because the value is set by % not by px? Because height seems be same and was set by px. What is the way to solve this one? The exercise is a li that is a child of ul that is the sibling of divs that make the groups.

The code is allowing all clicks to bubble up to the parent container, the UL, and is then delegated to the element that received the click (event target). The handler will know it element as this or $(this). Both represent the same object.
That is the preferred way to listen for events when several objects are contained. It only takes one listener which can be registered on an empty list. Newly added objects don’t need to register their listener as they already have one on the parent. That’s what makes them so powerful with dynamic content (but also valuable in static situations) since it never requires more memory.

Ok I got  it. I changed the code from

$(event.currentTarget).toggleClass(‘exercise-li-highlighted’);

into

$(this).toggleClass(‘exercise-li-highlighted’);

I tought that this and event.CurrentTarget is just a different syntax however there is a difference in functionality too. With this everything works fine.

Hi
I am working on my first app after completing the Web Dev Path.  Here is some code
$(document).ready(function() {
   
const lelele = () =>{
    $('#back-exercise').next().css('display', 'none');   
}
$('#back-exercise').on('click', lelele );
});

So basically I have list of body parts each created by div. Next to each body part div I created an ul (so it is a sibling). I want to toggle each list after I click on each body part that is a previous sibling. So this code here works but I would have to do a lot of copy pasta for each div/ul. I would like to replace it with a code like this
$(document).ready(function() {
   
const lelele = () =>{
    $(this).next().css('display', 'none');   
}
$('.exercise-type').on('click', lelele );
});

However I have read that $(this) is not working with next() ? So what can I do ?

Use a standard function so that there is a context for this other than window.
let lelele = function () {

};

Now this will be bound to the event object (the clicked element).

Hi everyone,
I’m currently going through the JQuery course and everything is going really well. However,  I’m also working on my personal portfolio and I want to use JQuery on it.
The Type editor that I use is Brackets and for some reason the code just does not work and I have spent the weekend and pretty much a whole day at work today googling on how to make this work.
step 1)  I added the script tags that a copied from JQuery.com and pasted it  at the bottom of the HTML skeleton right before the body tags on top of the script tag that links to the js file.
step 2) I created a file called  main.js, where  I wrote the JQuery code.

I also tried the code on CodePen and I know that the code is fine. Just not sure what’s wrong with Brackets 
Can someone please help?

We will need to see your HTML to explain the first error on line 2.

Haha , I was hoping it would be you who would come along 

Well the code is very long but I took some screen shots to simplify
I made some cards and added some links and the whole idea would be once the mouse enter the card, show the links.

and at the bottom, I added the CDN plus the script tag to the main.js page

The first thing would be to confirm that jQuery is present.
console.log(typeof jQuery)

It should come back as function. If it is undefined then there is a source issue.
As for where we load jQ, it doesn’t matter whether in the HEAD or the BODY since it doesn’t attempt to access the DOM until after main.js fires.


Screenshot 2019-04-15 at 20.47.10.jpg2880×1800 225 KB

This is what I got back.
To be honest I thought it would be a straight forward thing really. Copy and past the CDN, create a new file .js  and add the .


The console.log statement should be typed directly into the browser console, not the editor. Run your HTML code, and click the browser window… Inspect element. Click console tab.

You were spot on, It came back undefined. What do I need to do to fix this?

Trace the URL back to the source. Copy it and paste it into the location bar and see if it opens on a JavaScript file. If not, then the URL is incorrect. Go to th code.jquery.com page and select another minified version, say version 2.xx.yy. Right click, copy location, and paste it into your code. You can check first that it does indeed open on a JS file, to be sure.

IT’s becoming so overwhelming that I don’t know what else to do. I mean the same code worked at CodePen but its not working with Brackets.
I really appreciate your help but I don’t understand the last instructions. Which Url do you mean?
file:///Users/raphaelnunes/Desktop/New%20Portfolio/js/main.js
or
file:///Users/raphaelnunes/Desktop/New%20Portfolio/contact.html
How do I check if the url work on a js file?
I’m so confused, sorry. 

Use the URL in your script src, the one that points to the jQuery CDN.

I tried different minified versions on my code but nothing changed. I don’t know. 

Oh my god I can’t not believe this but I managed to get it working lolololol…

All I needed was to take out the js/ before main.js on the very last tag before the closing body tag.
Everywhere else I researched, indicated to put the js/ but apparently not.  Three full days on this and I finally managed to solve the issue.
Roy, you ara a great asset to this community thank you so much for your time helping me. I really appreciate it. 

You’re very welcome; and, thanks for the compliment.

I am not sure if this is the right place to ask for this kind of help. You are probably getting paid for solving these kind of issues or at least you are gaining a new sparkling point in your résumé.

First of all, if you are working with JavaScript and libraries written in JavaScript please invest few hours in learning how to debug JavaScript. This will be really helpful for you in the future, trust me 

Problems in your code are not related to jQuery. This is basic HTML and CSS (yes, really), you should read few articles about attributes in the HTML and about CSS selectors, let me explain.
From your code I assume that you want to filter out some div elements based on their jobs attribute, but this attribute is never defined, this is part of your rendered page:
<div class=""card"">
    <h1>Analytics Engineering Manager, Apple Media Products</h1>
    <h3>Full Time</h3>
    <h4>San Francisco, CA</h4>
    <p>Job Summary:
Apple is looking for a talented, passionate and driven engineering manager to lead a Popularity/Charts and Podcast Analytics Team for Apple Media Products in San Francisco. You will be part of the Apple Media Products Analytics Engineering group. Alongside other talented engineers in t...</p>
</div>

you see? jobs attribute is not there. You should do something like this:
const card = document.createElement('div');
if (job.type === ""Full Time"") {
    card.setAttribute('jobs', 'cbFT');
} else if (job.type === ""Contract"") {
    card.setAttribute('jobs', 'cbCT');
} else {
    card.setAttribute('jobs', 'cbPT');
}
card.setAttribute('class', 'card');

Is this complete and correct? I don’t know, you should check the GitHub API docs. So when you run your code now you have something like this:
<div jobs=""cbFT"" class=""card"">
    <h1>Sr. Associate, Data Scientist, NLP, Financial Services</h1>
    <h3>Full Time</h3>
    <h4>New York</h4>
    <p>Innovate. Collaborate. Shine. Lighthouse - KPMG's Center of Excellence for Advanced Analytics - has both applied data science, AI, and big data architecture capabilities. Here, you'll work with a diverse team of sophisticated data and analytics professionals to explore the solutions for clients in a...</p>
</div>

Much better, right? Now we can select the elements that should be filtered (or not).

Ok, this CSS selector:
$('.checkbox >div[jobs=' + this.id + ']')

is wrong. You want to select div elements with attribute jobs set to id of checkbox that are children of elements with class checkbox… what?  Here you should simply select all the div elements that have attribute jobs set to this.id, that is all.
This code does nothing:
else {
    $('.checkbox >div').show();
}

because this selector selects nothing. You can delete this.

So now, the best part. You wrote a logic (with errors, but I know what you wanted to do) that shows elements based on the selected checkboxes. So you used show method… but  you never hided these elements, so this does not change anything.

Corrected code -> https://repl.it/@factoradic/EcstaticWorkRegression

There is still a lot to improve. This code is not good. If you would like to work on it a bit more let me know, but after the deadline, this will be studying, not working.

 brouvnie:

$('#text').on('keyup', (event) => {
  $('.preview').html($(event.currentTarget).val());
})



I plugged that into my code and it worked as expected. Your code looks alright. Not sure what the problem is.

If i remove the font, weigth and size functions the textarea works, but if i add the functions the textarea doesnt work, it doesnt update and the input only shows in the textarea and not in the preview. Which mans it doesn’t work to select fonts and size and weight cause it doesn’t have something to select and use it on.

I just noticed that your properties are not in quotes.
$('#font').on('change', (event) => {
  let fontFamily = $(event.currentTarget).val();
  $('.preview').css({'font-family': fontFamily});
});


Update
Just spotted the issue…
fontFamily: $(event.currentTarget).val(); <<< semi-colon inside an object.

Got this to work once the semi-colon was removed.
$('#font').on('change', (event) => {
    $('.preview').css({
      fontFamily: $(event.currentTarget).val()
    })
})


Addendum
Thanks to this question I was forced to re-learn about JS property names. It’s not something I normally use so things get forgotten when you’re my age. JS names do not need quotes. Only CSS names do. The above confirms it, and a revamp of my original code made reading it even more clear.
Like you, I also used objects in my .css() methods, but since it is a single property, we may revert to the basic syntax and expect the same outcome. Note that JS names are not permitted.
    $('.preview').css('font-family', $(event.currentTarget).val())

I only bring this up so it is out there, not as a specific recommendation, or even suggestion.
In the end I reduced my code to a group of callback functions and a jQuery wrapper around the event listeners.
const changeText = event => {
  $('.preview').text($(event.currentTarget).val());
};
const changeFont = event => {
  $('.preview').css('font-family', $(event.currentTarget).val());
};
const changeWeight = event => {
  $('.preview').css('font-weight', $(event.currentTarget).val());
};
const changeSize = event => {
  $('.preview').css('font-size', $(event.currentTarget).val() + 'px');
};
$(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', changeText);
  $('#font').on('change', changeFont);
  $('#weight').on('change', changeWeight);
  $('#size').on('keyup', changeSize);
});

This should make evident to you that we do not need to write our functions in the wrapper. Again, not to make a point. They might be better in the wrapper so they are not polluting the global namespace. We see from this, especially, that jQuery works no matter where we call it from, as long as it is loaded.
The flip side of this is that the handlers didn’t need to be written in jQuery. We could have written in vanilla JS with the same effect. Mind, this is a jQuery project. Let’s get back to that…
$(() => {
  const chgText = e => $p.text($(e.currentTarget).val());
  const chgFont = e => $p.css('font-family', $(e.currentTarget).val());
  const chgWeight = e => $p.css('font-weight', $(e.currentTarget).val());
  const chgSize = e => $p.css('font-size', $(e.currentTarget).val()+'px');
  $p = $('.preview');    // cached node
  $('#text').on('keyup', chgText);
  $('#font').on('change', chgFont);
  $('#weight').on('change', chgWeight);
  $('#size').on('keyup', chgSize);
});

Note the cached node. This way we don’t have to keep querying it. We have it in  memory.
The $ is of no real significance except to tell the reader that p is a jQuery object, with all the attributes and methods expected of a jQuery object, hence,
$p.css()

and,
$p.text()

Both of those are jQuery methods that our $p instance inherits from jQuery.

Thank you so much, now the code works perfectly!

 field:

$(event.currentTarget.val())


We should not include the .val() method as part of the jQuery selector.
$(event.currentTarget).val()

For readability, and easier debugging I would recommend using an intermediary variable to hold the value.
let value = $(event.currentTarget).val();
$('.preview').text(value);

Above I swapped in .text() for .html() since we are injecting plain text, not raw HTML. Not a game changer, though; just makes more sense to me.

Edit
When you are done this project, ping this topic if you would like see how we can refactor it and make the code simpler and easier to read.

Thanks for the help! I finished the project and it would be great to see how to refactor it to make the code simpler.




 field:

it would be great to see how to refactor it


Right now you likely have about 30 lines of code inside the jQuery wrapper. Truth is we do not need to wrap everything, just the listeners.
If you look at each event listener,
jQueryNode.on(event, function() {})

We can remove that function to a standalone position outside of the jQuery wrapper.
function changeText (event) {
  let value = $(event.currentTarget).val();
  $('.preview').text(value);
}

or we could write it as an arrow function since it does not rely on a $(this) (or this) context.
const changeText = event => {
  let value = $(event.currentTarget).val();
  $('.preview').text(value);
};

Notice how the jQuery still works, even outside of the wrapper? That’s because the jQuery function is loaded into the namespace and can be invoked from anywhere. The $ is just an alias for jQuery which we invoke on a selector to access the methods.
Our main jQuery wrapper will look like this…
$(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', changeText);
  $('#font').on('change', changeFont);
  $('#weight').on('change', changeWeight);
  $('#size').on('keyup', changeSize);
});

Just as we have done with the changeText function, write the other three functions to correspond with the callbacks. Now the code is simplified and easy to read and understand. We could write each callback into one line but I think it better that we use intermediary variables to avoid any muddle.
Happy coding!

=> is known as arrow functions, it was introduced in es6. Maybe the jquery documentation hasn’t been updated to es6? Maybe deliberate? Who knows? You could google, see what you can dig up. Jquery seems to go out of fashion anyway, jquery was created to solve a problem that no longer exist.

25,Run jQuery in VSCode debug console?,"Get Help,jQuery",,8,"
Hello,
tl;dr: is there a way of running javascript code that includes jQuery in the debug console of VSCode, for syntax debugging purposes?
This might be a stupid question, as I have mainly worked in the Codecademy courses and I am just starting making my own projects.
I use Visual Studio Code. I am making a project composed of 3 files, .html, .js and .css.
In my project I am using some jQuery, it is properly referenced in the .html file, and if I run the project in the browser everything works (including the jQuery code).
However if I run the javascript file in the debug console of VS Code, I get the following error:
ReferenceError: $ is not defined
I imagine this is because jQuery does not get referenced in the .js itself, and because of that VS Code has no idea what I am saying. Is this correct?
Is there something I can do, or some extra package I can install, that allows me to run the code in debug console?
The reason I would like to do this is that the console gives me exact line+description of the error, which makes fixing syntax errors and typos a breeze.
","
does the debugger use nodeJS? Your assumption sounds reasonable, so then the first thing i would do is google:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48457867/referenceerror-is-not-defined-when-debug?rq=1

Ok, venturing off the Codecademy environment into real-life code editors is hard :’(
Thanks for the help! I followed your advice, and following that and other posts I ran an “npm install jQuery” (I already had Node.js v8.10.0 installed because I have been dabbling to make some Alexa skills).
Now I can run code through the console and it will not report jQuery syntax as errors, YAY!
BUT. I cannot import and export modules anymore. A quick google seems to say Node.js is not compatible with ES6 modules.
New question: how do I choose whether I use Node.js for a project or not? I honestly have some trouble understanding what node exactly is, which is why I have no idea how to use it or not use it once installed.
I do not have a computer science background, so I am having trouble because I do not understand the problem enough to look for information and a solution.
Even just an indication of what sort of topic I should look for to get a better understanding of all this would be immensely helpful.
In short: when I start a project, how can I decide whether to use node or not, in order to be able to use ES6 features that are not usable in node yet? Does jQuery require node?

And I do not think I changed anything, and it’s back to reporting
ReferenceError: $ is not defined

I have witnesses to the fact it had stopped doing it. So now I cnanot debug jQuery AND I cannot use modules. 

Did you also associate $ with Jquery? As mentioned in the stackoverflow answer
if you can’t use es6, why not use es5 for the moment? You can use require it seems:
https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require
which is also mentioned in the stackoverflow question, so you should be able to use that for import



 iani_ancilla:

New question: how do I choose whether I use Node.js for a project or not?


There isn’t a simple answer to that question. nodeJS is one of many options for back-end web development, some people dislike it while other people like it. What is your project?
i can understand it feels like drowning when going on your own after codecademy, all these tools and complicated setups, it takes time and persistence to go through it.
freecodecamp has an understandable explanation of what nodeJS is:
Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.
source
javascript used to be able to run only in the browser (how that happened is a different story altogether), until someone wrote code (an engine), to run javascript outside the browser.  Each browser also has its own JS engine. (js engine = term we used to indicate what you need to run JS code)
as for jquery, its unrelated to node. Given Jquery runs inside the browser, its just a library to make interaction with the web page easier (in pure JS, its more tricky)
The problem you then run into is when you have to debug jquery code with something that is power by node.

nodejs is your javascript interpreter
I imagine your debugger is nodejs, and what you’re seeing is some fluffy graphical in-between thingymajig.
If you’re running javascript outside a browser then you’re probably running it with nodejs.
Your editor is just that. An editor. Writes text. Doesn’t run code. Your editor is not your whole environment. To run it, you feed it to nodejs.
Syntax errors are when your code can’t be read. Doesn’t match the patterns that the language defines as valid code. That means it doesn’t run at all, you can’t use a debugger for this. Syntax errors are generally trivial, it’s like bad spelling.
To use es6 your code first needs to be translated to something nodejs can read. There are separate programs that do this, look into babel.
Oh and if you’re writing code for the browser then run it in the browser instead of in nodejs, in which case your question is moot because you just wouldn’t.

I understand a bit better now, thanks a lot to both!
I definitely had not grasped the concept that it is not the editor running the code, but node.js
And yes, my project will be run inside a browser, so I was going at it the wrong way.
As soon as the codecademy kiddie-pool is removed and one tries doing things “for realsies”, swimming suddenly gets a lot harder!!! (but more fun, too. If you like being frustrated)

You can set breakpoints (or whatever it is people do with debuggers) in chrome/firefox/probably some others too, probably no different from what you were looking for.
You still need to transpile to an older javascript version - especially if anyone other than you is to view/run it. Or, if your code runs as-is and you’re the only one then I suppose there’s no reason to care.

It overrides the default behavior, given that such exists.

Hi,
In this exercice, we use the .animate() method to make the .menu-button bigger, then smaller. Ok it does work. I did the exercice like it was asked and passed. But even though the text “MENU” becomes smaller again, The border of the nav bar isn’t coming up. It’s not smooth (one straight line as before)
Here is a screenshot of after using the method:

      });
      return false;
    }
  });
});

In the onclick listener there is a ajax request. This go’s to window.local as can be seen in the url. this has to go to where you want to save the posts.
i know this just tells you where the problem is and not how to fix them. But writing something to file or database aint something easy to explain or fix.
if you do not care about the database functionality than you can strip the code from the succes:function out of the ajax request.
Youre .onclick function will look like this.
$($submit).click(function() {
    if ($text.html() == """") {
      alert(""Plesea write a comment!"");
      $text.focus();
    } else {
      _data = $text.html();
	  
	  $loading.show().fadeOut(300);
      $listComment.append(""<div>"" + _data + ""</div>"");

30,Jquery taught by codeacademy,"Get Help,jQuery",,5,"
Why is the jquery taught at codecademy different from other sources on the internet?
for example, the anonymous function declaration is different and declaring jquery objects.
","
We need some context, here. Please post the URL of the lesson you are on, as well as your own code.

This is how anonymous functions are declared in the jquery exercise on codecademy.
$(document).ready(() => {
});
This is how anonymous functions are declared elsewhere
$(document).ready(function() {
});
Can you please explain why is it like that?

Would appreciate that link, please.
Both forms are valid. The arrow function syntax was introduced in ES6 and behaves like any function with a couple of exceptions…

no this object
no arguments object


JavaScript Arrow Functions

If you use an arrow function inside another function, it accesses that function’s this object, and that function’s arguments object.

Hi,
Thanks for the explanation.
I have watched a few videos to learn jquery and people did not use the arrow function which is why I got confused.
Here is the link to the codecademy lesson:

Hi,
When I create an event handler like this:
$("".foo"").on(""click"", function() {
  //insert code here
});

the website works as the instructions say it should, but the question is marked wrong.
Can you tell me why only “(fat) arrow functions” () => {}; work and not inline functions function() {}; work? They both work in jQuery normally as they should in the tutorial.
alphabeta367
","
What lesson are you on? Please post the URL from the location bar of the exercise page.

Well, it applies to nearly every secttion, but the one I’m on is: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery-event-handlers/lessons/mouse-events/exercises/intro-to-mouse-events?action=resume_content_item&course_redirect=learn-jquery

Are you getting any error message from the lesson checker?
Something of note concerning arrow functions. They do not have a context object (no this) so the function cannot be written with a context.
sayHello () {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
}

will raise an exception. this.name is not defined.
What code pattern is expected? What code are you entering for this exercise?

The this keyword is not related to any of the exercises I’m doing.
This is the code I used for the tutorial:
  $('.login-button').on('click', function() {
    $('.login-form').show();
  })
  
  
});

I would expect the function() {} keywords to work the same way as () => {} functions. Anyway, it works in the JavaScript tutorial.
And I am getting the following error message:

Did you change ’ __ ’ to ‘click’?

when I have done that.
Error messages basically appear when I use function() keyword.




 alphabeta367:

The this keyword is not related to any of the exercises I’m doing.


It will in time. I could see it wasn’t in this instance, though. Just tossed in that point.
The error message may be the only one in store for this SCT. If it appears only when you use function () instead of () => then that means it will only accept the latter.

34,Capitalization,"Get Help,jQuery",,6,"
Does it matter when you are typing your code, wether or not things in the code that are wrapped but aren’t seen on the actual website are capitalized?
","
Capitalization is a formal writing approach. It will not be necessary to capitalize any code, unless creating a Class structure.

what about cammelCase to improve readability of variable names?

You raise a good point, and one that follows a convention in JavaScript. The OP will be advised that only Class structures ever begin with a capital, which is what capitalization means.

True, but i never heard of cammelCase before i programmed for a while, so i am not surprised if people name this capitalization even though that is technically not correct. We will just have to wait for OP response.

a = value

value is assigned to a. In Python (and most programming languages) assignments are always right to left and always use = (assignment operator).

as opposed to,



 theorangemonkey001:

Use sqrt as the operator since that is the id of the button. Convert number to an integer in the Math.sqrt() argument.

37,I need help with a short script,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
Hello everyone,
I want to highlight a cell of a table depending on if its value is “yes” or “no”
I got an array by using
var test = $(‘table tr > td:nth-child(17)’);
Now I need to use the if method
if(test[i].innerHTML == ‘Yes’) {
test[i].style.backgroundColor =""#FCD"";
};
But I cannot get the complete function.
How can I use for or forEach to get it working?
I am not an expert of js but I think this is a simple task for experts.
I need just a hint. Please.

38,jQuery upgrade for my personal website!,"Get Help,jQuery",,13,"
Here I am, upgraded my personal website with jQuery! The website initially is a Final Project of HTML/CSS course.
http://alexprisazhny.com
Feel free to visit my site. I am very thankful for any opinions and feedback from you!
","
Wow! Its looks great! Very crisp and clean. Looks professional and well done over all! I can’t really see anything to improve on either. The setup is simple and easy to follow and the design doesn’t seem to have any flaws. 

Thank you so much for your kind words! It took me a while to read about design approaches, UI and UX. And there’s always something to work on! Right now I’m working on one thing - I want the full description of projects gallery item to appear over the page content when you click on its image in the gallery. It’s a bit tricky for me now, but over time I’ll make it!

Yeah that sounds like a nice addition but doable for one of your skill level. What would also be cool on that note, but when you get to gallery on the website and put your mouse over a project a little window pops up with a brief description of title of project and a general statement on what it does or is. Again not sure what that even involves but it would be a nice addition along with what your describing. A long description in the actual project gallery and then a short one on the actual webpage but when you scroll over it.

Thank you for your advice! It totally has sense!
Now I’m thinking about initially just displaying images in the gallery, but when you hover on one of them the short description with a name and a transparent background slides up from the bottom of the image. And if you click on it, you see its full description with several images within a larger block on top of the page content.

I completely agree that sounds efficient and just a cool way of accomplishing your goal haha

Thank you for your ideas. They are really helpful!)

Finally done it! Now description appears on hover and block appends on click.

Good work opensky1988, your work is very good, I only recommend to give a bit of shadow to the project part, I think it would give a more special touch, try to do it and inform me to see how. (This observation is more for personal taste)


Thank you for your feedback! At the moment I am at the final steps of converting my site to React/Redux. I will update it as soon as it’ll be finished.
I have code on GitHub if you’re interested.

Opensky1988 thank you for answering me, I will soon be opening an account in Github since I am new in this world of technology and especially in web pages. I’m barely learning, I’m doing a course of HTML and Css to then go with JavaScript.

I am also interested in entering any online study table to continue learning, therefore, if you know of any and / or can recommend me any course other than codecademy would be interested. Thank you.


I wish the best of luck in all you’re doing. Sounds like a good plan!
I think that depending on the path you choose (Front-End, Back-End or Full-Stack), you grab relevant technologies, make a portfolio (volunteering or/and open-source projects) and look for a job or make your own thing. There are also trends in technologies. I would recommend to look at the chances of finding a job in various niches, look for what you personally like and decide where you go next.
I personally chose React. CodeCademy gave me overall understanding and some practice, but you should have your own projects as well, since they make you apply your skills and sometimes put you in a challenging situation when you have to overcome frustration, think, learn and solve problems.
It’s not necessarily a certain course somewhere else. You can go on your own after obtaining a relatively specific stack of technologies.

We have your code, but nowhere to test it. Please post a link to the exercise. Thanks.

Sorry and thanks for your interest




 horror_vacui:

$(’.characters’).html(remaining);


SInce $remaining is not a jQuery object, we don’t need to add the $. Remove it from the assignment line and the above will work.
Technically, $post is also not a jQuery object (but a string) so it should not have the $, either.

Thanks, I managed to make it work after some more research and with your insight. Cheers

Despite i correct the route, the js function doesn’t work with the html i dont understand why, here a Pic of my function,

Sorry for the bad quality , hope you cam help me

What a trouble, taking a picture of your screen. Isn’t a screenshot easier?
Debugging from pictures is impossible, or really difficult, please give us a way (use jsbin or jsfiddle) so we have a replica of the problem to test on

Sorry, this is the function:

$().ready(iniciar);

function iniciar(){
	$(""#btnprocesarEjercicio1"").click(procesarEjercicio1);
}

function procesarEjercicio1() {
	var txeNombre=$(""#txtNombre"").val();
	var txtApellido=$(""#txtApellido"").val();
    var txtResultado=txtApellido+"", ""+txtNombre;
	
	$(""#pResultado"").html(txtResultado);

The idea is create three input, one say Name, another Last Name and a button that allows to show a result in a p. the final result must show LastName, Name.
Its the function correct to get the mentioned restult?



And what about the HTML code? Do i have to type it over and hope i make no typos? Come on, i asked if you could provide me with what i needed to replicate the problem, the html code is part of this.

Apologies, here the html:
<html>

			 <p id=""pResultado""></p>
			 <hr>
			 </body>
			 </html>


for starters, here:
<script src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js</script>

you miss a > to indicate the end of opening script tag, and the url is not enclosed in quotation marks, which is possible, just ensure you have html5 support then

I add the > on the script, but still dont working, i think i have a problem with the route:
<script src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js></script>
		 <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""C:/Users/mvdrandreani/Desktop/Practico 2/js/codigojs.js""></script>

its not  taking the js file, i will try on Netbeans to check if works, thank you

here:
$(""#btnprocesarEjercicio1"").click(procesarEjercicio1);

you don’t have a an element with id btnprocesarEjercicio1, so this click event won’t work.

Hello,
I’ve been learning jQuery for a few weeks, and I’ve always have been using .click(function(){}) (instead of .on(‘click’, ’ ') => {}), which does the same thing.
Problem is I cannot go further without using exactly what the exercise want. It would be nice if both were valid anwsers so users aren’t obligated to use practices they don’t like.
Why would I do this training if I already know what to do? Well I burned steps and I need to get some more basis and a reminder aswell.
Thanks, hopefully it helps future users
","
Nice point.
They don’t actually do the same thing, however. Elements that are dynamically added by your script will not be bound with .click but will be bound with .on you can read a little more here.
In the vast majority of cases though you are right they are the same.

49,What's wrong with the jQuery course?,"Get Help,jQuery",,3,"
Hi!
I started on the jQuery track, and while I’m liking it a lot so far, there are some issues with it:

It doesn’t display from my dashboard. When I log into Codecademy, there’s no easy way to get to it (that I know of); I have to google it.
When I’m done with a segment of it, it doesn’t go to the next segment, but takes me back to the homepage.
For segments I’ve completed, it shows that I’ve finished 1% of them only.

Is this a known issue?

50,To-do list adapted from jQuery tutorial not working,"Get Help,jQuery",,3,"
For practice I made some minor changes (changing CSS styling, changing IDs to classes, removing unneccessary type specifications) to the code used in the jQuery tutorial creating a to-do list and entered the CSS, JS, and HTML into CodePen. View the CodePen result. My version doesn’t add a list item below the form box upon clicking submit in CodePen, but the exact code works in the Codecademy editor.
Does anyone know the reason behind this discrepancy? There must be something going on behind the scenes I’m not aware of…

52,Hamburger Button Error,"Get Help,jQuery",,8,"
Hi all,
I am  currently trying to personalised my codecademy pro projects by adding more features to the projects I built using html, css, js, jq, and bs. As I believe the problem is in my JQ, I posted this in JQ forum, if it is not JQ related, I apologise in advance for posting it here.
The problem I encountered is in the jumpstart project when I decided to add a “hamburger” icon to the mobile version of the website. It started well, the navigation texts become nested in a “hamburger” icon when I shrink my browser. The problem arises when I close the hamburger button and enlarge my browser. The hamburger icon disappear (as intended), but so does the navigation texts. How do I make the text to appear automatically as I re-enlarge my browser?
I have tried googling for insights but no luck. Can anyone please help me out?

i put your code in a bin:

But the hamburger menu is not working in the first place? What i am missing?

Hi @stetim94 thank you for your reply,
I think we need to link the html with bootstrap, as my code involve bootstrap as well.  I have added it to the JS Bin, and the hamburger shows up. 

External libraries you are using, is always useful to include in the topic. I could have seen it, but its easy to miss something
now let me have a look

the toggle element has a width of zero:

Screenshot_2018-03-05_10-37-07.png1920×1049 237 KB

how is that?
i added the library:
http://jsbin.com/zegoxev/edit?html,output
but its not given the hamburger menu, please give me a way to replicate the problem. Which bootstrap library did you include? Such information is needed

Hi @stetim94 sorry for the late reply,
I included these bootstrap links
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"" integrity=""sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u"" crossorigin=""anonymous"">

I actually solved the problem. The reason why the navigation menu didn’t show up after I expanded my screen is because the “display: none” is added automatically when i close the hamburger menu. II believe it acted that way due to the way i wrote my jQuery code (pardon me for this as my jQuery knowledge is still limited). But in the spirit of do more and write less, i included a css syntax instead of  fixing my jQuery as follow
@media only screen and (min-width: 781px) {
  ul {
    width: 100%;
    display: block !important;
  }

And it works. 
Thank you so much for trying to help me out, i really appreciate it, also, sorry for the limited information i gave, i am still new to this community. 

Yep, now the hamburger menu works. Next time, ensure all the code is there to replicate the problem.
css uses a point system to determine which property to apply in case of conflicting properties.
using !important is a bad idea, given it screws up the point system. But then, jquery using inline style, so you have to use important.
Not a nice solution of jquery, i am surprised. It works, but its not the best solution. You would be wise to read upon the css point system to understand this
its seem to be named specificity, see here:

seems to be working fine?

The fiddle code is not mine, tried tried to refactor his code to mine, because I wanted the same result with my #headers, but mine doesn’t work… his does tho

here:
hdr = $("".titel"").height();

this will select an element with class titel, which you do not have?
Is there enough elements below the header you want to fixate to scroll down?

There are enough elements for sure. You are right about the titel, I was missing that one… but my headers er still not sticking to the top 




 ahmwac:

There are enough elements for sure


but it will only stick to the top, if you can scroll down enough. Or just make a single element and give it a massive height
Please make a fiddle with your code, this will make things a lot easier

No need, I figured it out now! Thanks!

55,Javascript form help - function(e)?,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
Hi guys!
I’m new to javascript and jQuery, and would like some help understanding this, and some help in the direction of creating my own mini form.
What I’m trying to do is create a mini form within a wysiwyg text editor. On click, this button will bring up the mini form which allows users to put in the information to generate a relative link.
For another button I used:
function createLink()
    {
        var link = prompt(""Enter the link"", ""https://"");
        editor.document.execCommand('createLink', false, link);

That worked because the ‘createLink’ command is able to create an absolute link.
Based off of another example I am working off of, this is what I have:
function(e) 
	{
  e = b.editor;
  var a = c(b.popup).find(""#logicalId""),
    f = c(b.popup).find(""#pageKey"");
  if ("""" == a.val() && """" == f.val()) return alert(""you must enter either logicalId or pageKey""), !1;
  if ("""" != a.val() && """" != f.val()) return alert(""you cannot enter both logicalId and pageKey""), !1;
  var d = ""\x3ca href\x3d'#' dfmltype\x3d'link' "";
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""logicalid\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  """" != f.val() && (d += ""pagekey\x3d'"" + f.val() + ""' "");
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#cssClass"");
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""class\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#htmlId"");
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""id\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  c(b.popup).find(""#target"").is("":checked"") && (d += ""target\x3d'_blank' "");
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#params"");
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""params\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#frag"");
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""frag\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#dataOln"");
  """" != a.val() && (d += ""data-oln\x3d'"" + a.val() + ""' "");
  d += ""\x3e"";
  a = c(b.popup).find(""#linkText"");
  d = """" != a.val() ? d + a.val() : d + ""[DEFAULT_TITLE]"";
  (d += ""\x3c/a\x3e"") && e.execCommand(b.command, d, null, b.button);
  c(b.popup).find("":text"").val("""");
  e.hidePopups();
  e.focus()
	}

But I am confused by the use of function(e), and how to refer to that in my php file, and the variations of ‘var a’ - ‘var e’?
I understand the encoding of the ascii characters, and the logical id or page key is what I would like the users to input. The dataOln, frag, and params, and target are sections that were existing in the template I started off with, but would be okay with losing.
Any help understanding this would be much appreciated.

56,Jquery - appending a string from an array to a div,"Get Help,jQuery",,12,"
Hello, I am new to jquery and programmering. I want to add an span container in my html document’s div container. The div that I want to append to on my html document looks this: .
<script type=""text/javascript"">

 var test        = ['A', 'B'];
 var counter = 0;

 $(document).ready(function(counter){
        $('#test').append('<span>' test[counter] '</span>');
        
      -if/else here?
       
}
});
</script>

","
here:
'<span>' test[counter] '</span>'

to join string and variables together you need to use +:
'<span>' +  test[counter] + '</span>'

where you should place your if/else depends on what it needs to do.

I need to check if I am at the end of my array, so if I am at 1 (‘B’), I would be at the end of the array, then reset the counter to 0, so I can loop my array, making the text change in the div, if that makes any sense… I am not the best at explaining, I’m sorry 

I want to do fadeIn() and fadeOut() events on them as well later on… if that is important knowledge

why use a counter like you did? You can simple make a for loop:
result = """";
arrayLength = test.length;
for (var i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++){
    result += '<span>' + test[counter] + '</span>';
}
$(""#test"").append(result);


var example = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'];
        textSequence(0);

        function textSequence(i) {

            if (example.length > i) {
                setTimeout(function() {
                    document.getElementById(""sequence"").innerHTML = example[i];
                    textSequence(++i);
                }, 1000); // 1 second (in milliseconds)

            } else if (example.length == i) { // Loop
                textSequence(0);
            }

        }

I need to this, just with jquery, since I want it to do jquery events on them such as fadeIn/fadeOut and change between the strings in my array 

how did we get from the code you posted first to this latest code?
Anything done in Jquery can be done in Javascript, Jquery is just makes DOM manipulation is a lot easier

Hmm, let me try to be more clear. The code above is in regular javascript, I know that it is just something I found, which does something close to what I want. The code loops through the array “var example = [‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’];”. What I want to do is make use of jQuery, for making the them fadeIn and fadeOut as the div changes it’s content…

So that each letter fadeIn() then fadeOut() one at the time:thinking:

I want to make something similar to this https://www.pleo.io/da/ under the “Sig farvel til” text at the homepage

fadeIn and fadeOut already allow you to set the duration of the fade, what do you need of me? I already helped you further
don’t expect me to code the solution, if you have specific questions, ask them, i will do my best to answer them

Did you get it :)? I have posted the URL here

yes, i did. Uhm… the course you take is no longer supported, as such, it might be bugged, you can try mouseenter and mouseleave:

$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function(){
        $(this).addClass('active');
    });
    $('div').mouseleave(function(){
        $(this).removeClass('active')
    })
});

that might work slightly better, make sure to enter with your mouse (in full screen output window after submitting), wait a few seconds before moving the mouse outside the div

It worked! Thank you!  mouseenter does the same as mouse hover? I guess?

I would still recommend updating the a supported version of a course
Well, they are similair but not the same.

the only purpose of jquery DataTables is display the data in html
But we can just construct the a table using php + html code:

if you want to use jquery DataTable you should make an ajax call.

65,Let variable and why you would change something,"Get Help,jQuery",,3,"
I am not stuck I just don’t understand the purpose of let.
My code works fine I just don’t understnad why you would write a change in a variable, RIGHT bellow the one that is already there. Isn’t that just unorganized? Why wouldn’t you just change the original code?
","
sometimes, a lesson teaches a concept (in this case, updating variable), which is a very useful concept, for the simple reason that we can’t always rewrite the code.
look at this bin:
http://jsbin.com/qonuzeyalo/edit?js,console
its some simple JS code (press the run button in top right to run the code), we ask the user for input, and then converting this input to lowercase. We can’t rewrite the code, because we don’t know what the user will enter.

I’ve having this track every time someone pushes a certain button on a webpage. When I press it, it does tell Facebook that there is an event, which is great but I see that it double counts it each time, then about an hour later, it will tell Facebook there was another click! I’ve click the button 6 times and it has told Facebook that it was clicked 18 times. Each time I click it counts as two clicks, then an hour later, it counts another one.
I’m super new to javascript so I haven’t quite been able to get the exact directions from Facebook.

67,Arrow functions not working in Web Safe Font Preview,"Get Help,jQuery",,6,"
I was bumping into a wall trying to complete the Web Safe Font Preview project, as I could not make the keyup event handler to work:
('#text').keyup(() => {
    (’.preview’).html($(this).val());
});
I was getting the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ‘toLowerCase’ of undefined
After reading about .keyup() and I changed the call back function to $(’#text’).keyup(function () {…}
and surprise!, it was working!
So. the question is: Is this because keyup event handlers do not support arrow functions or perhaps a bug in the interface for the exercise (given that the jQuery course is a beta version for now)?
","
if you want to use the arrow function syntax, you have to use .on() like you learned here:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery-event-handlers/lessons/mouse-events/exercises/on-mouseenter?action=lesson_resume&course_redirect=learn-jquery
okay, this example is for mouseenter, but the event can also be on() keyup
if you just want to use keyup, arrow key function syntax doesn’t seem to be supported

Hi,
So I came across this same issue today, with the arrow syntax and the keyup event. I am not sure what causes the issue, but I believe I have found a solution to make this work and use the arrow syntax. I will post what I learned from my attempts and maybe, someone might be able to shed more light on this.
I fully believe the arrow syntax should work because it was used in the previous jQuery project. It was used to update a count down for the remaining number of characters available on the Feedster Project here.
So here is my first attempt:
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', (event) => {
    $('.preview').html($(this).val());
  });
});

Which I received the following errors in console:

jquery.min.js:4 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ‘toLowerCase’ of undefined
at r.fn.init.val (jquery.min.js:4)
at HTMLTextAreaElement.$.on (main.js:3)
at HTMLTextAreaElement.dispatch (jquery.min.js:3)
at HTMLTextAreaElement.q.handle (jquery.min.js:3)

I was able to work out two solutions. As stated in the previous posts I ditched the ES6 and used the older notation and got it working with the following:
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', function() {
    $('.preview').html($(this).val());
  });
});

I was still sure that the arrow function syntax had to work somehow, because of the previous exercise I referenced. So I tried this and it works!
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('#text').on('keyup', (event) => {
    $('.preview').html($(event.currentTarget).val());
  });
});

This leads me to believe there is something awry with the ‘this’ value. I believe the ‘this’ being referenced is something other than out textarea with the ID of text. If that is the case I am not sure what ‘this’ is really referencing and how to make it reference our text ID.
I am glad I have two working solutions one with and one without the arrow function syntax, but I would love to know more as to why the one failed.
Thanks 

this standards reference to the window object:



MDN Web Docs



Window
The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.





using the arrow syntax, the value of this stays at the window object. While using the es5 notation, the value of this changes to the clicked object.

Thanks!
I also found this to have some helpful information regarding arrow functions and the this keyword



MDN Web Docs



Arrow functions
An arrow function expression has a shorter syntax than a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as...






that is also a good piece of documentation

68,Targeting by Class,"Get Help,jQuery",,5,"
Hello everyone,
Both at ‘targeting by class’ and ‘targeting by id’ I feel like I am having the same problem…
targeting by class
What I enter in the main.js document is exactly the same as the code that codeacademy fills out for you after failing a couple of times, yet the instructions only turn red instead of green. Did I forget something?
My input:
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('.product-photo').show()
});

targeting by id
This time I can manage to get the first of the instructions green instead of red, unlike targeting by class where I can’t even get the first one green, yet the second one once again remains red even though I enter exactly the same input as codeacademy does. Am I forgetting something in the css or html file or something?
Thank you,
Marie

Your code doesn’t pass me either, but is correct. Please report it as a bug through the form beneath the instructions on the left, then submit the code until the “Get Code” option comes up. You can use that to pass the exercise.

Why we should not right semicolon at the end of the line?

70,I'm having trouble linking my html code with my javascript code,"Get Help,jQuery",,4,"
I just finished the JQuery lesson, and I wanted to practice writing some code so I downloaded TextMate for Mac and started with some really simple html so I could practice linking a javascript document to the html, but I can’t get the javascript to run. Here’s my html.
    <!DOCTYPE html>

</html>

I have JQuery and my javascript in a folder called ‘js.’ As you can see, I also tried loading JQuery from online. Neither worked, and I can’t get any code to run by putting it in between the <script></script>. I found that <noscript> stuff and threw it in so I could see if maybe my browser was the problem, but it only shows up when I open the html in TextEdit, so that makes me think the problem is with my javascript? Here’s the script I’m trying to link to.
$('h3').append(""-success!"");
$(document).ready(function(){
	$('#george').click(function(){
		$(this).fadeOut('slow');
	});
	$('div').css(""color"":""white"");
});

after it didn’t work the first several tries, I put something above the $(document).ready() because I figured maybe my document just wasn’t loading. Does anyone have any advice? Am I making an obvious mistake?
Here’s the CSS I’m using, it’s working fine.

Thanks, I copied what you had and it still didn’t work, so I figured it was a browser thing. I opened the console in Chrome and it ran, so my guess is that the browsers I tried it in (Chrome and Safari) just both block local javasript until you open the console. Once I did that, I could load and reload it as much as I wanted.
Thanks again!

71,How to use jQuery .each() with json value,"Get Help,jQuery",,5,"
I am reading an json file values but not i have to show the values in HTML table structure. I want to loop through the .each () method and then show the values. Please help me?
","
looking at jquery docs:
http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
we are given the code:
var obj = {
  ""flammable"": ""inflammable"",
  ""duh"": ""no duh""
};
$.each( obj, function( key, value ) {
  alert( key + "": "" + value );
});

we can use the same code for a json file.
i found some json data online, combined with the each documentation it was pretty easy:
http://jsbin.com/vupawofotu/edit?html,js,console

jQuery each is used for looping. First use .getJSON to fech json file data like this:
$.getJSON(""demo_ajax_json.js"", function(result){
       $.each(result, function(i, field){
            //create table
        });
    });

Now inside the function(result){} call jQuery each method to loop through the data. Now to make a table of data use .append() method adding ‘tr’ & ‘td’ on every loop.
Basically I am giving you some ideas which you can apply and do this.

thank you for the explanation.

Same problem here. Tried a few things with mouseenter but they were all incorrect. But after a few incorrect tries you are able to go further

UPDATE:Please disregard. I got past this by guessing what Step 3 wanted. I added an event handler for the shoe-button and after running a couple of times finally got the ‘Try Again or Get Code’ popup. Clicking on ‘Get Code’ pretty much displayed the correct code for completing Step 2.
My guess is that there is not supposed to be a ‘Step 3’ haha.
What exactly did you do to be able to go further?

This, and lesson 5 are not doable without resorting to Get Code.

I wonder why none of the administration is taking care of this. I sent a bug report too, and also think many people did so.

When it works its way up the priority chain it will get addressed. There are only so many hands and there is much to do on the roll-out end of things. We were warned there would be wrinkles, at first.

I’m seeing the same issue although bugs are to be expected sometimes. Why release the course if things like this are still happening? Surely this all get tested thoroughly before release…

looking at the css documentation:

setting multiply properties takes a dictionary (from documentation):
.css({ ""background-color"": ""#ffe"", ""border-left"": ""5px solid #ccc"" }) 

if the background-color is then stored in a variable, you can simply do:
.css({ ""background-color"": backgroundColorVariable, ""border-left"": ""5px solid #ccc"" }) 

nice and simple.
not sure what you currently do, margin is a property, absolute is a value, but of position

¿Cual es el error que está recibiendo?

Porque omitiste las comillas en los artibutos href y src en el cuerpo de tu html?

No lo haces. Ese es incorrecto.

Usted no cerro la categoria img en CSS.
Tambien le faltan comillas a el link de la . Todos los hypervinculos siempre estan en comillas.
Lea y compare con mas atencion, esto toca aprenderlo despasio.

Ya lo solucioné, muchas gracias a todos.

82,How can I use jQuery plugins predefined events?,"Get Help,jQuery",,2,"
How can I use jQuery plugins predefined events?
Most of the jQuery Plugins introduce predefined events in their documentation, Is there any rules in general for implementing those events?
For example in special case Zebra_Accordion Plugin (a tiny accordion plugin for jQuery) or jQuery-Accordion or any other plugin defines some Events like below:
Zebra Accordion Events:
onClose:
Event fired after a tab is collapsed.
onOpen:
Event fired after a tab is collapsed.
If I want in this case to add a div with special font awesome character (like fa-chevron-down) after box title when collapsed (collapsed state) and remove that character and replace it with a new character (like fa-chevron-up) as box title when expended.
I try below code but it seems that something is wrong:
$('.Zebra_Accordion').on('onOpen', function(e) {
      $(this).append( ""<span class='fa fa-chevron-down'></span>"" );
  });

$('.Zebra_Accordion').off('onClos', function(e) {
      $(this).append( ""<span class='fa fa-chevron-up'></span>"" );
  });

I’m beginner and not an expert, So please try to give a detailed answer or any reference as I don’t know anything about Plugins events and some other expressions.
Thanks

Where ‘target’ is the element after which you want to add something and the bit between <tag>s is the HTML element you want to add. You can add <h1>s, <div>s, or any other valid HTML you like.

So the problem is, that Mario is moving to the left, but I cannot move him in any of the other directions. At one time I was able to move the small window on the right but at the very moment I save and submit Mario is only to be moved to the left in Full Screen.

```

// Left arrow key pressed
case 37:

@pycoder50577

It wasn’t working before. It is now. Thanks!!

So, got it working now!
And no further questions, it just needed some more research with your hint on my mind, but thanks.
@rcodeman

I had the same problem as the OP, where my initial .animate() input code entry for case 39 looked like this:
{right: “-=10px”}
This did not result in movement, but upon changing the input code to {left: “+=10px”}, it worked.
So, OP’s margin selection terminology of “up,” “right,” and “down” didn’t seem to work.
In my case, I couldn’t get “right” and “bottom” to work. (“left” and “top” worked fine.)
The case of using “right” not working took me off guard, since the hint directly references using {right: “-=10px”} as acceptable alternate code.
I did ultimately complete the exercise exclusively using “left” and “top” like in @rcodeman 's example, but being a completionist sort, it irked me a tad that I couldn’t go back and use the alternative code.
So what’s the appropriate identifier for altering the margin’s right and bottom values?

this is really helpful thanks

This is the format we are using in the course:
$(document).ready(() => {

});

I recall this format:
$(document).ready(function() {

});

What is the difference? The latter would be an anonymous function. The former makes no immediate sense to me. What does the arrow (=>) achieve?

This course has been upgraded to ES6+ which permits the use of what is called, arrow function syntax.
ES5
var bar = function () {

};

ES6
const foo = () => {

};

I shall Google that. Thanks for the guidance!

i begin to do another exercise .

The coding area is a bit quirky, its best to copy the whole line 6 (even the blank spaces that represent the tabs before the code) to the very beginning of each of the lines 8,12 and 16.  This then eliminates the yellow ‘tab and spaces’ error and the program executes correctly.

Ive been messing around trying to add various effects to Mario. I got him to turn around when he moves to the left and to jump, but he only jumps to the right. I’m trying to get him to jump left when he’s facing in that direction. I’m thinking he’s probably not jumping left because when I check for the “flip” class on the img it’s checking the document on “ready” at which point it doesn’t have that class, but I’m not sure how to get it to check for the class when the key is pressed.


$(document).ready(function() {
    $(document).keydown(function(key) {

We can use the CSS transform property…
        switch(parseInt(e.which,10)) {
            case 37: //left
            $('img').animate({left: ""-=10px""},'fast').css(""transform"",""rotateY(180deg)"");
                break;
            case 38: //up
            $('img').animate({top: ""-=10px""},'fast').css(""transform"",""rotateZ(270deg)"");     
                break;
            case 39: //right
            $('img').animate({left: ""+=10px""},'fast').css(""transform"",""rotateY(0deg)"");  
                break;
            case 40: //down
            $('img').animate({top: ""+=10px""},'fast').css(""transform"",""rotateZ(90deg)"");    
                break;
        }

That takes care of direction Mario is facing. Will need to play around to get a jump into the picture.

Okay, on the logic that moving up or down won’t involve a jump on the horizontal axis, but moving left to right, or right to left could feasibly accommodate a jumping motion on the vertical axis…
function moveMario(key) {
    switch(parseInt(key.keyCode, 10)){
    case 65:
    case 37:
        img.css(""transform"",""rotateY(180deg)"")
        .animate({left:""-=10px"",top:""-=45px""},'fast','linear')
        .animate({left:""-=9px"",top:""+=45px""},'fast','linear');
        break;
    case 83:
    case 40:
        img.css(""transform"",""rotateZ(90deg)"")
        .animate({top: ""+=16px""}, 'fast');
        break;
    case 87:
    case 38:
        img.css(""transform"",""rotateZ(270deg)"")
        .animate({top: ""-=16px""}, 'fast');
        break;
    case 68:
    case 39:
        img.css(""transform"",""rotateY(0deg)"")
        .animate({left:""+=10px"",top:""-=45px""},'fast','linear')
        .animate({left:""+=9px"",top:""+=45px""},'fast','linear');
        break;
    default:
    }
}
jQuery(function($){
    window.img = $('img');
    $(document).keydown(moveMario);
});


Ok cool. Thanks.
Transform is definitely useful here. I take it adding “linear” smooths out the jump action. I’m wondering if there’s a way to have normal side movement with the arrow keys and add a jump in either direction with space bar. I couldn’t manage to nest a “if /else” statement into the switch case, I don’t know if that’s possible, but was looking for a way to determine which direction he was facing so jumps in either direction could be linked to one key.

My thinking above takes into account gravity. What goes up comes down. There is no side to side unbalanced force in nature unless Mario is an electron in a magnetic field. Animation should be perceived as natural, imho.

No error messages. My code runs but one line has no effect.
Basically, i want the remove button to be seperated from the rest of the input, so that the input only disappear if the remove button is clicked - and not when the input itself is clicked.
To achieve this, i’m looking to get both the related input button and the input value to be removed at the same time when the user click on the button.
It almost works. However, the input itself doesn’t get removed. The line that doesn’t work is
$("".list"").closest($(""input"").val()).remove();

It doesn’t remove the input, so right now clicking on the remove button of an input only removes the button itself. How can i write this line to remove the input generated along the button when the user click on “add”, without removing any other inputs or buttons ?

Oops, try again. Did you target the 4th li child of the ordered list? Check the Hint if you need help.

```

    <li>Start with the function keyword</li>
    <li>Inputs go between ()</li>
    <li>Actions go between {}</li>
    <li id= ""yolo"">jQuery is for chumps!</li>

‘’’

","
 (function() {
        $target.fadeOut('fast');
    });

why are you using anonymous function for it?
you can directly write

$target.fadeOut('fast');

and if you really want to use that function then call it at the end
 (function() {
        $target.fadeOut('fast');
    })(); // () calls that function


Oh i forgot i had to call it, i percieved writing the function inside document.ready as sufficient for it to trigger itself on page loading.
Thank you very much for your quick answer, was really helpful
PS: i want to use unecessary anonymous function beacause i don’t know what i’m doing yet, and i like to fail in every way possible until i can write things even in uneccessary complex fashion as soon as i can/find how to, so as not to fail in trickier settings later on. Some mentality i got from training to play piano, where i didn’t settle for being able to clear a performance - instead i trained for being unable to fail whatever i was playing

I’m trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with this code for toggling the “highlighted” class on the div “text”. the code works for toggling the text just fine but submitting gives me the
“Oops, try again. Did you replace your .addClass() with a .toggleClass()?”

text is currently an undefined variable? Selecting elements requires strings:
""text""

remember that if you want to select an element by id, the selector should start with a number sign

Nope, I tried I absolutely every variation of “text”, “#text”. ect The code works in the box to the right in nearly every setup and I only finally got past using $(this) for the toggle class. My point is the exercise makes the window work for highlighting in nearly all examples but only passes when I used a different selector…Think It might need some work.

text is an id selector, using $(""text"") would select <text></text> element, which we do not have, how do we target elements by id using jquery?

Ok text was an ID in the HTML which is why the script works on the page. also then please explain to me the presence of this instruction on the step immediately preceding this one where we learned to assign .addClass

Remember: You aren’t selecting anything, you are modifying your element. This means that you do not need # or . before your class.





 xxch3m1stxx:

Ok text was an ID in the HTML which is why the script works on the page. also then please explain to me the presence of this instruction on the step immediately preceding this one where we learned to assign .addClass


this concerns addClass and toggleClass:
toggleClass(""highlighted"")

see, now . or # or needed given we add a class, however when selecting an element by id we still need the number sign (#)

Like this?

3ce355f082143a36e693b02980d5d944dfeb2d97.png1644×754


yes, but on line 3 use $(""#text"") as well, or $(this)

or like this?

61ba9c74e01fc7d24fa0bea8a93f01b1892735b6.png768×713


seriously? $(""text"") will select <text></text> element, which we do not have
we select by id, which requires a number sign in the selector

ok then please help me understand what was the meaning of the instruction of the previous step that told me specifically not to use # or . i’m not understanding the difference they were trying to declare and my inclination was to use # but I was instructed otherwise

no, need for using # or . when using function like addClass or toggleClass given there tasks involves classes only, so there is no need to distinquish between element, id and class
when selecting anything using: $(selector), you need to distinquish between element, class and id, so you need to use # when selecting element by id, and . when selecting elementy by class. Its even in the instructions:
Remember: You aren’t selecting anything
not selecting anything applies to addClass and toggleClass, $() is still selecting like you learned
thing we learned don’t change all of a sudden, the new explanation only involved the function you learned. Not selecting, which you already knew, that didn’t change

sorry I had been Typing my reply when you reply to my last post. I’m understanding what you are saying about using the text selector by ID. That statement was only intended to refer to addClass and toggleClass what confused me is that I passed the previous step with this code which seems like it shouldn’t have worked then.
    $('#text').click(function() {
        $(text).addClass('highlighted');
    });
});

Why is text acceptable here then? or should it have always been ""#text""

here:
$(text).addClass('highlighted');

the two accetable answer are ""#text"" and this, not sure why it let you pass now

look at .on() documentation:

the the third argument should be a function, here is an example from the docs:

Not sure I get the question. The code looks fine.

The target element is a DIV which initially has no highlighting. If we examine the style sheet we will find the selector rule for, '.highlighted'. It will look something like,
.highlighted {
    box-shadow: 0 0 8px #FFD700;
}

When we click on target, the handler is triggered that adds the class to the #text element. The browser redraws the page with the new highlight effect on that element.

 omkaranuja:

$p.remove();


While valid, it goes beyond what the exercise expects. No harm, just give it what it wants.
$('#two').after($('p'));

$('p').remove();

There really is no reason to cache the jQuery object in this exercise. A transient selector is all we need.

When creating a jQuery object with a p selector, it builds a collection of all the P-nodes in the DOM. We refer to that as a node list.but it is much more than a normal list. It’s a JavaScript collection of every selector node type and all their children. It’s a list because there are many possible parent nodes,
Because of the wide coverage of a node type selector, they are the least desirable to have in our code, if not specifically suited to the design. That is where class comes in so we can isolate a select group of node type elements that are related by marriage, not as family. They all have the same class.
Where it gets interesting is when we create an element of any node type, P-node or any other, and make it a jQuery object.
$p = $('<p/>').text(""I'm a sprite"");

Now you have an object that resides in memory and is dynamic in insertion and removal, as well in text. Both can be changed on the fly anytime during a session.
Take some time to play with this idea and it will give you some practice with the before and after methods, as well as many others. You’ll have fun, guaranteed. Sprites are fun.

okay! let’s break it down! the first thing is the key.which function, which uses the key parameter defined in the keydown function. Whenever a key is pressed, key.which returns a string that identifies it.
then, you have parseInt() which takes two parameters. First, a string that it converts into a integer for use in our switch, and the second parameter (10 in this instance) is the radix (a mathematical term that google can explain better than I can)
let me know if you have any other questions!

Fenris thanks, but stop for a while. Maybe you wanted to say parseInt() function which it’s here as the only switch statement condition and this function being a condition of the switch takes two arguments itself. The first one is key.which followed, as you said, by the radix of 10. This very key.which I wish I understood.

i changed it with fadeOut, the divs are fading but i keep having an error: $e(…).a.cacher is not a function

Can i see an updated version of your code? Maybe now is a good time to refresh the page

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('button').click(function() {
     $('.vanish').fadeOut('slow');   
    });
});


works fine now, try refreshing page/different browser

tried to refresh, and changed the browser, still not working:
error: $e(’.disparaitre’).a.cacher is not a function. (In ‘$e(’.disparaitre’).a.cacher’, ‘$e(’.disparaitre’).a.cacher’ is undefined)

okay, post:

CSS:
.vanish {
height: 100px;
width: 100px;
display: inline-block;
background-color: #F38630;

}

    });
});

its the french one, that explains a lot. Just write something invalid, it will crash the validition and let you pass, your code is fine, the exercise is bugged
anything invalid:
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('button').click(function() {
     $('.vanish').[fadeOut]('slow');   
    });
});

will do

Thank you! like you said the exercise is bugged, i tried what you wrote: SUCCESS!

animate does not have a sense of direction, but relative offsets from the top and left boundaries.
top: '-=10px'  => move up
top: '+=10px'  => move down

left: '-=10px'  => move left
left: '+=10px'  => move right

It is not wise to declare a listener inside another handler.
The click handler should be independent of the hover handler.
   $('div').click(function() {
       $(this).fadeOut('fast'); 
   });
   $('div').hover(function(){
       $(this).addClass('red');
   });

Alternately since they are both bound to the same selector,
   $('div').hover(function(){
       $(this).addClass('red');
   }).click(function() {
       $(this).fadeOut('fast'); 
   });

This is commonly known as method chaining. Both listeners will have bindings to the same object(s).
There is an even more refined approach using on if you are interested. Ping this topic if you would like to see it.

Thanks for your advice!!  To separate the function looks right.
I am stuck on the addClass part which i missed out on.   Can’t recall what I should put here or how to find it?

When the listeners are separated, your addClass statement is correct. However, if your would like the color to revert back to green on mouseleave, then use, toggleClass instead. Recall that the green class is the default. jQuery preserves the className that is present when it toggles another class into that node.

Toggle is great but doesn’t seem to do the trick to turn the planet red.
(document).ready(function(){
(‘div’).click(function() {
(this).fadeOut('fast'); 
   });(‘div’).hover(function(){
$(this).toggle(‘red’);
});
});




 nicolib:

.toggle(‘red’);


toggleClass('red')
As for method chaining, think of the order of the mouse events. hover comes first, click comes after that.
Check my example above, but use toggleClass instead of addClass.

what i need instead of toggle class is a class that will change the planet to red when my mouse hovers over it or clicks it.   Any ideas?

The exercise is to have the planet turn red when we hover, and fade out when we click. The code I gave you above is all you need. If you are trying to do something else, then that falls under, experimentation and will mean moving this topic to Corner Bar for open discussion of ideas. We do not take that road in the Q&A.
If you have locked in your thinking upon a certain set of ideas which are wrong or not practical, then all you have done is blind yourself. In programming this is never a good thing to do. It will keep you from accepting working solutions while you force your own into being.
We must keep an open mind and toss aside the blinders. Ideas come from all directions, and we need to be receptive to them else we stymie our own ability to think creatively and out of the box.

.border-radius is not a built-in jquery function like height and width. The reason for this is, the manipulation of height and width is already built into javascript core.
To fix this, jQuery includes a special .css method, which allows you to add any custom css rules you want. You can see this mentioned in the instructions
the code you’ll need to use is something like $('div').css('border-radius','10px')

thanks, i just found out same this on website…
$(“div”).css(“border-radius”, “10px”);

If you look into your CSS-file
you will see
img {
    position: relative;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
}

Loading the HTML-file
will put your image in the =left= =top= corner.
So the only valid animations would be
top: ""+=10px""
top: ""-=10px""
left: ""+10px""
left: ""-10px""

https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/web-beginner-en-bay3D/2/3?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1 (Exercise 11 and 12)
I’ve copied and pasted the correct code for ‘script.js’ SEVERAL times. My code works on the HTML both in preview mode and full screen mode. The program itself is just wigging out or something. After double and triple checking that my other files were set up correctly.  The error message reads: “Oops, try again. Please follow the instructions on the Full Preview page to test your code.”


$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function() {
        $(this).fadeTo('fast', 1);
    });
});



","
So did you follow the instructions on the Full Preview? You need to move your mouse to the DIV then wait 2 seconds.

Yes I think there is a bug here.
Can make it work in JSFiddle but only if you include the jQuery CDN link
https://jsfiddle.net/aftonandpaul/ej6j5eno/
Perhaps theres a bug in the jQuery CDN for that particular exercise?
Also noticed theres an error message on the exercise page Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
suspocious indeed…

Yes. My jQuery functions are identical to the examples in the Full Preview page instructions(left side bar). Yes, like I mentioned, the functions work in the html preview (right side bar) both in half preview and full screen mode.

I can’t get the mouseleave to work. I put in 0.5 but it keeps telling me thats wrong.
This give me an error…
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function(){
        $('div').fadeTo('fast',1);
    });
    $('div').mouseleave(function(){
        $('div').fadeTo('fast',0.5);
    });    
});


I get the same error too. I put 0.5 and still get an error message.

The code looks perfect. I had this same issue and @oscartbeamish’s advice is what fixed it. I hovered my mouse over the div, waited 2+ seconds, removed mouse from div, waited 2+ seconds. I thought it was broken the first few times but it just took patience.

I am experiencing the same issue with this specific challenge. “get yourself in…”

I am still having the same problem if you can solve it please tell me what am i supposed to do

I have the same problem.
Code:
$(document).ready(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function() {
        $('div').fadeTo('fast', 1);
    });    
};

Saved and submit, waited two secs, mouse over the div and waited for 2 secs, mouse removed from the div and waited for 2 sec again. Nothing happened.
Edit:
I reset the code, entered my code above, and now the Full page Preview cant even detect my mouse over the div anymore. Waited for more second and still nothings happening…

Lol, the problem is in my code the whole time.
I was good after I changed it to this:
$(document).ready(function() { 
    $('div').mouseenter(function() { 
        $(this).fadeTo('fast', 1); 
        }); 
});


I really couldn’t figure out the problem with my code.
Even after using this in script.js
(document).ready(function() { 
    (‘div’).mouseenter(function() {
$(this).fadeTo(‘fast’, 1);
});
});
and this.
(document).ready(function() { 
    (‘div’).mouseenter(function() {
$(‘div’).fadeTo(‘fast’, 1);
});
});
I was able to get through this by changing the opacity value in stylesheet.css to “1”. Like this:
div {
height: 60px;
width: 100px;
border-radius: 5px;
background-color: #69D2E7;
text-align: center;
color: #FFFFFF;
font-family: Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
opacity: 1;
}
If you are at the point where you are going to give up on JQuery because you can’t get through this problem, this is one way around it.

@rubysolver63009
Even i faced this problem, but I now I know the solution.
in get yourself in… after you click on save & submit code move your mouse cursor to the click me block. Keep your mouse in the block for 2 seconds…(see bottom of screen for instructions) and then move the mouse out. This will indeed solve the problem.
For …get yourself out you need to just get in the block and move out…(no need to wait for 2 seconds inside the block). But once you are out of the block, wait for 2 seconds on the screen and then proceed.
I did it this way and completed both of the exercise.

Simply change ‘div’ to this in the second function
('div').mouseenter(function() {
  (this).fadeTo(‘fast’, 1);
});
That fixed the problem for me!

This method worked for me! Thank you so much!

128,Re. DOM lessons in javascript,"Get Help,jQuery",,3,"
To make our projects visible when the ‘Recent Projects’ button is clicked, jQuery provides a function named show, which is the opposite of hide.
To show an element, the syntax looks as such:
$(’.example-class’).show();
show is attached directly to the jQuery selector.
show will change the CSS attribute display: none to a visible display property, therefore showing the element.
For the above under java script I have coded the following:
function main() {
('.skillset').hide();
  (’.skillset’).fadeIn(1000);
('.projects').hide();
  (’.projects-button’).on(‘click’, function(){
// ('.projects').show();

You should type “.Click( )” instead of “.to Click”.




 nikkiliu:

You should type “.Click( )” instead of “.to Click”.


click should also be lower case.
(document).ready(function(){
(‘div’).click(function(){
$(this).fadeOut(‘fast’);
});
});

where is the mistake?
(document).ready(function){
    (‘div’).click(function){
$ (this).fadeOut(‘fast’);
});
});

i don’t understand either ? where is the mistake ?
(document).ready(function){
(‘div’).click(function){
$ (this).fadeOut(‘fast’);
});
});

There is a whitespace between $ and (this):
Try out:
(document).ready(function){
   (‘div’).click(function){
$(this).fadeOut(‘fast’);
});
});

So within your code you need a space between your parenthesis and curly brackets for both lines like so, I tested your code and it works now. Hopefully that helps some, sometimes the best option is to see the answer and then go from there.
(document).ready(function() {
    (‘div’).click(function() {
$(this).fadeOut(‘fast’);
});
});

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div').click(function() {
   $ (this).fadeOut('fast');
   });

This works for me I hope it will for ya’ll!

I changed the double quotes to single quotes, and I still receive the message. I also followed the instructions fully on the preview editor (hovering over the div). Does anyone know what’s wrong with my code? Thanks!


$(document).ready(function(){

  $(""div"").hover(
    function(){
        $(this).addClass(""active"");
    },
    function(){
        $(this).removeClass(""active"");
    }
  );

});

Be sure to follow the instructions on the full page preview.

Click inside the window to give it focus
Mouse over a div and pause for two seconds
Mouse off the div and pause for two seconds
Return to editor


Have the same issue with the same problem.
This is the error code: Oops, try again. Unable to get property ‘1’ of undefined or null reference

have the same issue.

I had the same issue. I eventually got it to work by only putting my mouse into only one of the div’s and taking out it.

The same. Will subscribe.

Yup, worked for me!

<div id=""title"" class=""highlighted"">I'm highlighted!</div>

.highlighted

#title




 de3nt11:

//why do I not need a # or . before calling it here?//


As you already say that you are adding a class

.addClass

you don’t need a .

As you already know, you have to use ("".class"")  or  (""#id"") when selecting an element using jquery
The (this) keyword is used when referring to the exact same $(“object”) that is called inside the function.  So, for example:
the bold items refer to the same object.  So you will first have to use the # or . to select your element, and if you refer to that same element within a function of then or method on that object, then you refer to that object by using the this keyword.



 de3nt11:

(document).ready(function() {
    (""#text"").click(function() {
$(this).addClass(“highlighted”);
});

Oops, try again. It looks like you didn’t add a  after the  with ID #two.

```
var parag=(“p”);

var div_two=(""#two"");
$(""#two"").after($parag);
<do not remove the three backticks above>

 terapro80445:

var parag=(“p”);


This is an empty node list. There are no paragraph elements in the document at load time.
First we should consider what effect we are aiming for. We have two DIV elements, each with an ID. We want to first insert a P element after the first div, then remove it and insert after the second div.
$('#one').after( ... );

Without using a predefined object, we can write a paragraph tag into a string and replace the ....
'<p>Hello world!</p>'

In the second line (run the code with just the first, to start) we will target that paragraph with a jQuery selector.
$('#two').after($('p'));

We have targeted the only paragraph in the page, and moved it to a now location in the DOM.
That is the simplest form of this exercise. Study it closely, and ask if there is something you do not understand. Then we can move forward to your code.

so i need to create a  tag first before assigning it to a variable…?




 terapro80445:

so i need to create a  tag first before assigning it to a variable…?


If you do not want to write it directly in the statement, then, yes. Create it, store it and then insert it.
var p = '<p>Hello world!</p>'

Note that this is an element, but not a jQuery object. Witness what happens when we do this…
$('#one').after(p);
$('#two').after(p);

To get the same effect as above, we still need the jQuery selector in the second statement.
$('#one').after(p);
$('#two').after($('p'));

Now if that is absorbed, we can go into your attempt, and get it working with jQuery magic.
$p = $('<p/>').text(""Hello World!"");

We  have created an element node that is transient in memory until such time as the variable reference changes. Permanent if that variable is never changed. The node is an ojbect in memory, and not yet in the DOM. What’s cool about it is that it is a sprite object, meaning we can move it around and modify it all we want during the session. It can be removed from the page and reinserted on the fly, at any time.
$('#one').after($p);
$p.text(""The world is moving!"");
$('#two').after($p);





 mtf:

('#one').after(p);
(’#two’).after§;


i ran this code, but it still gave same error
var p = ‘Hello world!’
('#one').after(p);
(’#two’).after§;
        
With this code,
    var p = ""<p>Hello World!</p>""
    $('#one').after(p); 
    $('#two').after(p);

I get this output in the console…
Div #1

Hello World!
Div #2

Hello World!

Yes, it should raise a lesson error because it does not move the element from one place to the other.
To do that, we need to implement the jQuery selector in the second line. p is a paragraph element in memory, and not a jQuery object. Its variable reference is forgotten when the literal element is inserted in the DOM.

Hi.
The integration of html/css and javascript is not the easiest of tasks to learn or teach. It looks like you’re confusing their example with what you need to write to get it to work.
They say to “write a variable named $skillset. Set $skillset equal to a jQuery selector for the skillset class.” So let’s break that down step by step.
We’ll start with a variable called $skillset:
var $skillset = ???

Next, they say to “Set $skillset equal to a jQuery selector for the skillset class.” I can see how that would be vague and confusing in english but it’s fairly straight forward in practice and the answer is actually in their “learn” section, just a tad out of context.
What we are doing is setting the $skillset variable to the HTML Element on the page so that we can do stuff with it like show or hide it, etc.
So what’s the skillset class?
In css it would be .skillset so we use that in our javascript as well. .skillset is just css until you send it to $() which does jQuery magic for you.
So our result for step 1 is simply:
var $skillset = $('.skillset');

Now, essentially $skillset = <div class='skillset'> which is the wrapper around most things visible on the page.
Hope that helps.
Zach

<Below this line, add a link to the EXACT exercise that you are stuck at.>

for section 13/14, we are required to realize the function that when added items are clicked, they could be removed. Trying to use the following code:
$('.item').click(function() {
    $(this).remove();
});

is incorrect . The explanation is that
when the DOM is loaded, so by the time your document is ready, it’s already decided there are no .items to .remove()
As I understand, when referring to ready, it is when the webpage firstly loaded at which no items are added.  However, when we add some items, these items are added into html DOM. So does that mean that $(document).ready() only execute one time and will not refresh after new items are added? Then here comes the controversy: the webpage will always refresh after new items are added. I am not sure I understand this clearly.

yes, you described it perfectly.



 citystrawman:

not when done with jquery or vanilla javascript
That is the great thing, we can manipulate the DOM without reloading the whole page
Jquery is a javascript library, if we use .click() the event is only added to the elements which are on the page from the beginning
on the other hand, if we use .on('click', function(){}) the click event will be added to elements which are added to the page dynamically. This has to do with the JS functions used by jquery

Hmmm, thanks for your explanation! At first I thought that when DOM is changed the whole HTML content changes. But as you have explained, we can manipulate the DOM without reloading the whole page.

As you see on the little preview window everything looks ok and when the Add button is pressed it appends stuff. But when I focus on the text input field and if I press enter after, everything on that window disappears.
Thank you.

Could you provide the script.js code you are using in ASCII format…

Hi, it is the default of the lesson, I havent changed anything.
(document).ready(function() {
    (‘button’).click(function() {
var toAdd = (""input[name=message]"").val();
        (’#messages’).append(""""+toAdd+"""");

Are you looking for
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1626107/text-in-html-field-to-disappear-when-clicked

Nope, I think I didnt explain it clear. What I am reporting is a bug that in jquery lessons (I tried it on a few). When there is an input field, and if I press enter after focusing in this input field everything in that white little preview window disappears. Could you please go to the lesson of Review of jQuery Events and as soon as it opens focus on the input field(whether there is something written or not) then press Enter? I apologise that I am not good at explaining stuff but I believe you will get my point if you can try it as I did so.
Thank you!

It seems that the HTML DOM has a “form” element that seems even unnecessary in the lesson, thus whenever Enter is pressed it tries to redirect the page to an non exiting one. I am not in the position to suggest a solution to CodeAcademy but I would like to know why there is a “form” element ?

here:

you need to use + to join/concatenate variable and string together just like you did with toAdd

Use alternate quotation marks like this:

instead of your:
$("".list"").append( ""<div class=""item"">"" + toAdd + ""</div>"");

Isn’t this different to the instructions? Anyway, onwards!


Did you put ‘.pull-me’ inside a $() to make it a jQuery object?

$('.pullme').click();

in case this hasn’t been resolved already, your code is 100% right, you’re just missing the - from in between .pull-me

I myself have been using a Chromebook and so far all the challenges have worked. I don’t think it’s because of that. On this challenge itself though, the only key that works is the left key to move the sprite. I noticed that a couple of yellow triangles(left of the lines of code) shows up saying “mixed spaces and tabs”. Not sure what that means.

You have to hold the cursor by clicking the mouse in to the picture, since we are pressing down the document. Then start pressing the left, right, up or down arrow keys.

so now your class of text element is .highlighted, so if you know want to select this in css you get ..highlighted

I still do not understand.

you add a class .highlighted to your element, you should add a class of highlighted to your element

The syntax example that is provided is not clear in explaining that the “.” is unnecessary following the .addClass function. See below. In the example the proper syntax for the selector is $(’#text’) the ID indicator is included, whereas the Class indicator “.” is omitted.

('selector').addClass('className');
(‘selector’).removeClass(‘className’);

This is the type of inconsistency really needs to be spelled out for newer programmers.

but in the example you can see the full stop being omitted:
The syntax looks like this:
$('selector').addClass('className');
$('selector').removeClass('className');

And nothing is stopping learners from checking the official jquery docs



 cssace17041:

I guess it’s connected to every time a user like me changes code, the preview window fetches the graphic again (thus leading to many many requests to photobucket to fetch the graphic again). I included a link (mega.nz) of a screenshot i took of how it looks. And I also cant see the mario graphic from the lesson i linked to (in the past the photobucket graphic was shown behind the fetched graphic, like in the Krypton lesson right before, it still showed the krypton planet in front of this photobucket 3rd party hosting)
Sorry for the long post

Truth be told, it’s neither client nor server side. It’s photobucket’s.

<Below this line, add a link to the EXACT exercise that you are stuck at.>

Hey,
I’m trying out a bunch of lessons/projects from scratch locally and I want to make a jQuery file that all my projects link to, rather than copying the file to each new project folder. Is this something that’s fine to do? The jQuery file would be in a master folder beside project folders like so:
What would my <script href=""""> have in between the quotes? Normally it would be just the file name if it was in the same folder.

```
```
Web_Projects Folder:
Project1 Folder:
Images Folder
index.html
style.css
script.js
Project2 Folder:
Images Folder
index.html
style.css
script.js
Master jQuery Folder:
jquery-3.2.1.js
<do not remove the three backticks above>
","
You need to include the file location. In this case it would be somethings like this.
<script href=""WebProjectsFolder/MasterjQueryFolder/jquery-3.2.1.js"">

Unfortunately it’s not working still. I changed href to src since I think that’s the right thing to put? But still not getting a connection.
This is how my html doc is searching for it. Do I need to go further back? My test site folder that I’m working out of is within Web-Projects. Going far enough back it’s C:\Users\Me\Desktop\Web-Projects…
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css""/>
    <script src=""Web-Projects/MASTER_jQuery/jquery-3.2.1.js""></script>
    <script src=""script.js""></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id=""header""></div>
    <div id=""primary-section""></div>
</body>
</html>

I’m trying to simply remove a div on click as a test using this code in style.css and script.js
CSS
#header {
    border: 1px solid black;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
}

JS
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""#header"").click(function(){
        $(this).hide();
    });
});


There’s a post on Stack Overflow that suggests having something like ../MASTER_jQuery/jquery-3.2.1.js which is interesting. Using Brackets it seems to recognize what I’m trying to do now. Unfortunately, I’m still not getting a hide response from jQuery.

where is your document ready? Coding in jquery, you always need document.ready()

Oh, i thought it was this kind of step by step exercise. I’m new in jquery. Thanks a lot.

maybe, but you will need to include document.ready(), otherwise there is no reason for the jquery code to execute, without executing nothing will be inserted

Thanks again, for the patience.

The function is called slideDown with a capital ‘D’.  Your example has a lower case ‘d’. That would cause both errors.

What error? I just tried it and it works.
When you hit Save & Submit, does it go full screen and when you click Click me, does it work? After that it should let you pass the exercise when you leave full screen.

I have the same probleme, everything works fine when i click on click me but i can’t pass the exercice. And i have this error : "" $e(…).a.cacher is not a function "".

As ghost said, your code is working fine. So there’s nothing wrong with it on that end. However, sometimes Codecademy does experience a bug. Try copy and pasting your code then refreshing your browser. Restarting your broswer etc. can also fix this issue if a simple refresh does not.

Hi,
I have the same problem with this exercise.
Bests regards.

162,"Leave out type=""text/javascript""","Get Help,jQuery",,9,"
HTML5 makes

type=""text/javascript"" 



optional because browsers default to it. Why doesn’t Codecademy leave it out?
","
The main reason for including it would be to support browsers that do support HTML5. Additionally, not all user agents support HTML5. Until everything is caught up (meaning older technologies no longer in use) there is a marginal need for this declaration. The main thing is it does not affect anything, either way in HTML5 browsers. They just ignore the attribute.

HTML5 has been around quite awhile. Which browsers don’t support it?

We all know the answer to that. Browsers are not the real issue since there has been universal support of the idea to not support older IE. But we forget there are millions of pieces of equipment in the hands of users with accessibility challenges. Old equipment that costs thousands to replace; thousands they don’t have, so they keep the equipment running as long as it will.

@mtf Do you know about accessibility equipment? I want to learn. What accessibility equipment would not support HTML5?

Older screen readers, for one. Those programs are very costly and most people I know that use it were only able to acquire it and the equipment they needed with government grants and support from CNIB. That is not a trough one can loop back to very often. Eventually the old stuff will no longer be in use, but that is a sunset that is difficult to predict.

Accessibility is important to me, so I gathered information from multiple sources.
Here are a couple of articles from different years that compare screen readers. The first is from an accessibility blogger, Becka11y, who does her own research. The article is dated 2016, and shows the improved interpretation of websites using HTML5: Screen Reader Support for New HTML5 Section Elements
The 2nd article is by Leonie Watson (aka Tink). She is thoroughly involved in the web standards community, and is losing (has lost?) her eyesight. The date is 2013. It, too, compares screen readers and reveals their improved interpretation of websites using HTML5: Screen Reader Support for HTML5 Sections
Just to verify that my research represented real people, I got information from more people who actually use screen readers. You have to use a version from 2011 to have incompatibility problems with HTML5. And if it can’t interpret HTML5, it has other problems as well!
I can now reach 2 conclusions: 1) HTML4 is for screen readers about 6 years old and older. 2) HTML5 helps the visually impaired interpret websites.

The edge cases are dwindling, though we have to admit it is one or two steps behind the norm. I would agree that the time frame has taken us out of the woods, but we are still in the bramble and meadows.

$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""#button"").click(function(){

","
instruction:
.append() a <div> with class=""item"" to the .list div
but you’ve write list class
$('.list').append('<div class=""list"">' + toAdd + '</div>');
should be class=""item""

""('.list').append('<div class=""list"">' + toAdd + '</div>');""
It is already appending in the <div> with list class [(’.list’).append]. so you do not need to tell again inside the .append object [.append(’]. find an example below-
    $('#messages').append(""<p>""+toAdd+""</p>"");

This code will add the input item to message div as 
, test the code with different tag, i.e. h4 tag or li tag ,  so you will understand the difference.
Happy Coding 


in your html should be

' + toAdd + '


Is an issue also in enclosing checkListItem in quotes? example: var toAdd = $(“input[name=‘checkListItem’]”).val();
In the previous exercise we were not expected to use quotes. example: var toAdd = $(“input[name=checkListItem]”).val();

you can simply select different elements:

you can use even use class and id selectors

Sorry I got it wrong, I meant to say properties.
What I mean is if there’s a way to do this: $(“div”).css(“background-color”, “black”, “border-radius”, “10px”, “height”, “200px”, etc etc)

sure, but then the property values should be supplied as object:
.css({

Hi everyone, this code is working fine and does what its suppose to, add/remove class when hover over, however It’s throwing error which doesn’t make sense:
Oops, try again. It does’t look like your background color changed, is your hover adding the class active



$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').hover(
        function(){
            $(this).addClass('active');
        },
        function(){
            $(this).removeClass('active');
        }
    );
});

I also had the same problem… On what were you ? I was on chrome

yeah I was also on chrome! I found solution by clearing css cache - CTRL + F5 and it worked…

The problem is I am actualy on a chrome book, I’ll try on my windows.

I don’t think that should be an issue since it’s just browser based and should work fine. having text editors is so much better tho and much faster so perhaps its not bad idea getting Windows/Mac/Linux.

The same problem… Clearing cache, did not work for me. Could anyone explain how to resolve this issue in another way?




 pablospaniard:

ork for me. C


HI @pablospaniard Its tiny bug on their side, its just the action is too quick and is not being recorded. Go fullscreen and when you hover over elements - keep the mouse on for few seconds before moving to the next element then it works fine! its just takes time to register change of color. I just double checked and it works… let me know if it doesn’t.

Thank you. It helps.

I had the same problem and you answer solved it ! Many thanks !

I am still getting an error msg on this,“Oops, try again. Unable to get property ‘1’ of undefined or null reference” using IE 11. Tried hovering for many sec on each div.

@pacifictinker I got the same error with Edge.

I switched to Chrome and got another error:

It does't look like your background color changed, is your hover adding the class active?


so I cleared the CSS cache using CTRL + F5 as @deeqoo suggested, and that didn’t work.


Then I saw that @deeqoo passed on another suggestion to hover over the div for a few seconds, not too quickly. This last suggestion worked in Chrome!



Yep, I got it to work in Firefox too. Seems like a site issue, but this compatibility is part of the baggage with JS. I think I will set up a webserver today and figure out how much of these exercise work as intended on a live site. Thanks!

169,6. Why are we adding opposite effects to the same handler?,"Get Help,jQuery",,3,"
<PLEASE USE THIS TEMPLATE TO HELP YOU CREATE A GREAT POST!>
So on exercise 6, “jQuery events, Hover”, we add the exact opposite effects to the div (addClass and removeClass) within the same event handler (hover). How does this work? Surely if you hover, it would apply one of the effects, not both?

<Below this line, add a link to the EXACT exercise that you are stuck at.>

Exercise example : 
('div').hover(
    function(){
      (this).addClass(‘highlight’);
},
function(){
$(this).removeClass(‘highlight’);
}
);
<do not remove the three backticks above>

no, the .hover is smart, it will see that there are two functions to this event, it will execute the first function for mouseenter and execute the second function on mouseleave
