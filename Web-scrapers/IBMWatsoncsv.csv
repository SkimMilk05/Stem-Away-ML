1,"When saving a visualization figure into png on IBM Watson, where is it really saved?","Get Help,IBM Watson",retrieving-content,1,"
I am preparing slides for my data visualization project on IBM Watson. When trying to save each figure into a png file, I use the following code:
plt.savefig(“filename.png”)
Where can I find now these png files? Where are they physically saved in the cloud?
Many thanks in advance!

2,Analyzer is not working,"Get Help,IBM Watson",,1,"
For a start, I can’t seem to navigate the IBM cloud to see the username and password in the credentials. When I create an instance I receive an api key and url.
Either way I get the following message:
TypeError: init() takes at least 2 arguments (3 given)
was anyone able to run this code successfully?

16,4/4 is loading indefinitely,"Get Help,IBM Watson",,3,"
When I try to run the code in 4/4, it starts loading and never finishes - it’s loading indefinitely without any error message.  There was a similar post here where people solved this problem by using Internet Explorer instead of Chrome, however this does not work for me. I tried it with Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome, on Windows and Mac OS X, same result.

17,Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly,"Get Help,IBM Watson",,2,"
This is my code:
for status in statuses:
    if (status.lang =='en'):
        text += status.text.encode('utf-8')

When I run it in Python 3.5 I get this error:

Can’t convert ‘bytes’ object to str implicitly

Is there a way to fix this without using Python 2.7? Would really prefer to keep it in Python 3.5.

I have completed all the steps in the Learn the Watson API course. In the last step, after all the code in place when I run the program, it just keeps running for a long time without any result (no error message, nothing). Any idea why that might be happening? Appreciate your help.

Having a bit of trouble with Learn the Watson API 4/4 - I’ve entered my PI credentials and the code won’t run properly, even after resetting the code and starting from scratch. I press “Run” and it seems to be continuously loading and not continuing to the next stage.
Could anyone help?

Same with me.
Anyone who can help?
Codecademy members?

Getting the same error here, just posting to keep thread open

I switched to IE instead of Chrome, and was able to continue. I noticed the BlueMix website seems to load a bit faster in IE as well, maybe the API doesn’t work as well in non-IE browsers?

thanks for the tip - I switched to IE and was able to run 4/4. Completed the lesson and ran immediately back to Chrome

Unicode handling differs quite a lot between python2 and python3, If that code is targetting python2 then you’re better off running it with a python2 interpreter.

Don’t post your API credentials, they should be kept private.
It’s a codecademy problem.


Did it get solved for you? I am having the same problem

Never got solved for me. I’m a Pro member so I broached the topic with their Customer Support Live Chat… they said they would add it to their bug list.
In any case, I just kept moving through the other lessons which 90% of the time worked well. I really like this course actually. IBM Watson’s services are really mind-blowing, and the instructions here in CodeAcademy are very simple and intuitive.

24,Node reply script for twitter does not actually reply,"Get Help,IBM Watson",,2,"
This twitter script can currently tweet the selected user once they tweet, but instead of actually replying underneath the tweet, it tweets it as a standalone new tweet. How can I get it to actually reply instead of make a new tweet? I’m using Twit API: https://github.com/ttezel/twit
Here’s what I have:
    console.log('The bot is starting');

var Twit = require('twit');

var config = require('./config');
var T = new Twit(config);

//Setting up a user stream
var stream = T.stream('user');

stream.on('tweet', tweetEvent);

function tweetEvent(eventMsg) {

   var replyto = eventMsg.user.screen_name;
   var text = eventMsg.text;
   var from = eventMsg.user.screen_name;

   console.log(replyto + ' '+ from);

   if (replyto =='other user's handle') {
    var newtweet = '@' + from + ' Hello!';
    tweetIt(newtweet);
   }

}

function tweetIt(txt) {

    var tweet = {
     status: txt
     }

    T.post('statuses/update', tweet, tweeted);

    function tweeted(err, data, response) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(""Something went wrong!"");
      } else {
        console.log(""It worked!"");
      }
    }
}

25,Twitter methods,"Get Help,IBM Watson",,5,"
I’m in the Twitter Querying II Section and I was curious about the method being used twitter_api.GetUserTimeline. I searched GetUserTimeline in Twitter’s development site. https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline
There are a few other parameters for this that Codecademy doesn’t have us input. I’m assuming if I wanted to use any other methods I would search in here. But how would I know which parameters are vital? At first glance I would think all are necessary.
","
Here -> https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline in the parameters section all optional parameters have a grey optional label and required parameters have required label.

Wow I can’t believe I missed that, thanks! Funny how like all of them are optional 

You’re very welcome!
It depends on the method  In some cases, you have to pay attention to the extra notes, like here:

Always specify either an user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline.

So they both are optional, but you have to specify one of them

26,Hitting an error (event with the sample code) - 'Api' object has no attribute '_Api__auth',"Get Help,IBM Watson",,2,"
Hi there, im running through the Learn the Watson API and am on step 7.
However, even when i use the sample code provided i see this error on the right…
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “CelebrityMatch.py”, line 17, in 
statuses = twitter_api.GetUserTimeline(screen_name=handle, count=200, include_rts=False)

File “/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twitter/api.py”, line 3601, in _RequestUrl

AttributeError: ‘Api’ object has no attribute ‘_Api__auth’
Google suggests there may be a conflict between packages Twitter and Python_twitter - however i dont see the twitter package installed with i do ‘pip freeze’
any thoughts?
