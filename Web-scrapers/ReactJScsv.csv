1,Ravenous Part 1 TypeError,"FAQ,React.js",,5,"
Hello all currently working through the Ravenous project.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/react-development-setup-and-ravenous-part-1/projects/create-prj-components
I keep getting this error when I try and open using npm start.
TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null

Module../src/components/App/App.js

C:/Users/dan_g/OneDrive/Documents/Codecademy/ravenous/src/components/App/App.js:6

not too sure how to fix this. Any help will be appreciated!

This is my code in App.js:
import React from ‘react’;
import ‘./App.css’;
import SearchBar from ‘…/SearchBar/SearchBar’;
import BusinessList from ‘…/BusinessList/BusinessList’;
class App extends React.Component() {
render(){
return (

  <div className=""App"">

    <h1>ravenous</h1>

    <SearchBar />

    <BusinessList /> 

  </div>

);

}
}
export default App;

React.Component is a class, so no parentheses are needed.
class MyComponent extends React.Component

■■■■. I was searching for so long and knew what line it was but just couldn’t see it.
Just needs an extra pair of eyes. Appreciate it!

Sometimes the obvious things are the hardest to spot…

2,Jamming - my search button is not working - invalid redirect URI,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,6,"
Hi everyone! My search button is not working! I am at step 95  of the Jamming project and realised that I did not include an “onClick” attribute to the button but then when I click on search it gives an error “INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI”
What should I do?
Thanks in advance !
P.S. anyone else noticed that in the video the instructor did not put an onClick attribute to the button and yet it worked? How is that possible?

Can you copy in some of your code so we can see?
Did you make sure to put the redirectUri in to the Spotify Dashboard?
Did you ensure to put the redirectUri in to the code? (A user recently had the same problem and hadn’t done this).


Hi there!! Thank you so much for replying! After reading your comment I check the name of my redictUri on Spotify and realised that I had a type error in the name   also I had an type error in the window.setTimeout method! That’s what I get for not copy pasting code…!!Now everything is working fine! I will try to deploy it now…hopefully it will work!

Good to hear you found out. Some time you just need to comb through your code to find these errors. It can often be an infuriating experience!

Yes I know! Now I have another problem! I did the surge step and even though I changed (by copy pasting) the redirectUri both in the spotify dashboard and my Spotify.js there is an error again popping up for invalid redirectUri. I did a ‘surge teardown domain_name’ to take it down as it was not working. Then changed it back to my localhost URI and still not working when I click on the search button

If you copy your code I can look.

Hello @giga3072569673, welcome to the forums! Could you please post your code, as we can’t see the code you have written when we follow the link.

hello @giga3072569673 I had very similar issues when I finished the ravenous part 1, all my styling was off  and I couldn’t figure out where was the problem. What I did is I copied all the given css again and pasted in my css files. I found out my App.css was wrong and that sorted the problem of the entire project.
But i see some issues with your code that i’m not sure if it’s related:
<p>{`${business.state} ${business.zipCode}`}</p>

<p>${business.reviewCount} reviews</p>

You don need to put placeholders cause you are writting directly on a <p>.
try to change to:
<p>{business.state} {business.zipCode}</p>

<p>{business.reviewCount} reviews</p>

I hope that helps!

4,Jamming - Feature Reqeust: Playlist Edit,"FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
Has anyone successfully implemented the ability to fetch a users playlist and use the Spotify Change a Playlist’s Details PUT request?
I am successfully retrieving playlist details.
However, I am having an issue of the PUT request being sent (to change the playlist title), but returning a 403 Forbidden message, despite re-issuing an access-token with the correct permissions granted on login.
This is  the code, if some one could look at it with fresh eyes -
 savePlaylist(playlistName, uriArray, userId,  playlistId) {

        if (!playlistName || !uriArray) {
          return;
        }

        const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
        const headers = {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
        };

        //Check for existing playlist id. If True, change playlist details (title).
        if (playlistId) {
            console.log(userId);
            console.log(playlistId);
            return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/${playlistId}`, {
                headers: headers,
                method: 'PUT',
                body: JSON.stringify( {name: playlistName })
            });
        }

        return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`, {
            headers: headers,
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify( {name: playlistName })
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(jsonResponse => {

I’m trying to figure out if this has to do with the warning message on my window console. I tried to reset the hot module replacement with react and give up since I did not what I was doing. it may take sometime to figure out. Any idea in how to solve it would be appreciated.
Thank you

Never mind folks. I forgot to update the button with the “onClick” attribute.
Thank you

Which step was this said at?

I’m having a similar issue.  No where in the project did it say to add onClick to the button ( guess it’s a given???) but I’m trying to understand why we have an onChange and an onClick for the same search?  My Search button isn’t giving me an error but it seems to be searching “object” which is somehow being passed in as my argument when the Search button is clicked.  onChange works fine, you type something in and it immediately has the results.  I tried adding term.replace(’ ‘,’%20’)   (because spotify needs spaces replaced with %20) in my search() method in the Spotify.js but that just gives me an error of “term.replace() is not a function”.  So I seemed to have traced the issue to step 69 in the project where it asks you to “pass the state of term to this.props.onSearch”.  I’m passing the searchResults in as an object and that’s all it sees when I try to use term.replace(’ ', ‘%20’)?  I’m not sure if any of this helps but that’s where I’ve traced my issue to.   Still haven’t resolved it though.




 matthansen2926362581:

I’m trying to understand why we have an onChange and an onClick for the same search?


The onChange attribute triggers the handleTermChange() in SearchBar.js, which sets this.state.term to the current search term (before the search is executed).
The onClick attribute triggers the search() method in SearchBar.js, which passes this.state.term (current search term) to this.props.onSearch, in turn triggering the search() method in App.js, in turn, triggering Spotify.search(), having passed the current search term down the chain.



 matthansen2926362581:

Check that you are passing ‘this.state.term’ from SearchBar.js (not this.term).

Hi! I am having the same issue. What did you put in the “onClick” attribute for the button?

6,Jamming project-issue with adding songs to new playlist,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,14,"
Hi everyone!
I a struggling with step  45 - 47(see link: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/jammming/projects/jammming-prj).
In those steps, I am supposed to make the ‘+’ clickable so songs from results can be added in the new playlist. While I complete the step successfully, the text of the song title and artist disappears when the song is added to the playlist. !
I am including 3 pictures: 2 pics of my code and 1 pic of the outcome so you can understand the issue better.

I’m not sure if Step 45 is done correctly from the given images. Is the .addTrack() method created in the Track component?

Yes! The .addTrack() method is created in the Track component!

Can you show me the whole Track.js?

import React from ‘react’;
import ‘./Track.css’;
class Track extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {

    super(props);

    this.addTrack = this.addTrack.bind(this);

    this.removeTrack = this.removeTrack.bind(this);

}

renderAction() {

        if (this.props.isRemoval) {

         return <button className=""Track-action"" onClick={this.removeTrack} >-</button>

        } else {

        return <button className=""Track-action"" onClick={this.addTrack}>+</button>

    }

        

}  

addTrack(){

    this.props.onAdd(this.props.track);

}

removeTrack() {

    this.props.onRemove(this.props.track)

}

render() {

    return(

    <div className=""Track"">

         <div className=""Track-information"">

            <h3>{this.props.track.name}</h3>

            <p>{this.props.track.artist} | {this.props.track.album} </p>

        </div>

        {this.renderAction()}

    </div>

    )

}

}
export default Track;

Thank you for your reply. I think steps 45-47 are done correctly. Then, if the problem still persists, it may be due to an earlier step. How was the .addTrack() method created in App.js?

This is my App.js:
import React from ‘react’;
import ‘./App.css’;
import SearchBar from ‘…/SearchBar/SearchBar’;
import SearchResults from ‘…/SearchResults/SearchResults’;
import Playlist from ‘…/Playlist/Playlist’;
import Spotify from ‘…/…/util/Spotify’;
class App extends React.Component{
constructor(props){
super(props);

this.state = {

  searchResults: [],

  playlistName: 'My Playlist',

  playlistTracks: []

};

this.addTrack = this.addTrack.bind(this);

this.removeTrack = this.removeTrack.bind(this);

this.updatePlaylistName = this.updatePlaylistName.bind(this);

this.savePlaylist = this.savePlaylist.bind(this);

this.search = this.search.bind(this);

}
addTrack(track){
let tracks=this.state.playlistTracks;

if(tracks.find(savedTrack => savedTrack.id === track.id)){

  return;

} 

  tracks.push(tracks);

  this.setState({playlistTracks: tracks});

}
removeTrack(track){
let tracks=this.state.playlistTracks;

tracks = tracks.filter(currentTrack => currentTrack.id !== track.id);

this.setState({ playlistTracks: tracks });

}
updatePlaylistName(name){
this.setState({ playlistName: name });

}
savePlaylist(){
const trackUris = this.state.playlistTracks.map(track => track.uri);
Spotify.savePlaylist(this.state.playlistName, trackUris).then(() => {
this.setState({

  playlistName: 'New Playlist',

  playlistTracks: []

})

})
}
search(term) {
Spotify.search(term).then(searchResults => {
this.setState({searchResults: searchResults})

})
}
render(){
return (

tracks.push(tracks);


This line may be the cause. What if you change it as follows?
tracks.push(track);


Now I cant see the results of any change I make because it throws another error :
“INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI”
so now every time I refresh it shows the above message…

It seems that you are doing steps ahead. I think it’s an error related to Spotify.js. I don’t know much more than that, but when I searched for INVALID_CLIENT in this forum, I found some related topics. One of them is this:

Thank you for giving me the link. I basically finished the Jamming project last night and errors keep showing up. Let’s see if I can fix it now with the new link that you sent me 
Thank you so much!

Hi again! So now I am having way more issues.
I am including pics
How i it possible that there are problems in files I did not even touch? Also, I do not understand what is wrong with the trackList. What the error points out is not very specific
Jammin-issue4857×884 35.9 KB

I’m not sure, but it’s probably not a problem with the TrackList component. The this.props.tracks might not have been passed correctly from its upstream (Playlist or SearchResults).
For example, in App.js you are passing this.state.searchResults by SearchResults={this.state.searchResults} (where the first S is uppercase) to SearchResults component:
<SearchResults SearchResults={this.state.searchResults} onAdd={this.addTrack} />

In SearchResults.js, if you passed this to TrackList by tracks={this.props.searchResults} (where s is lowercase) like the following, it is mismatch.
<TrackList tracks={this.props.searchResults} onAdd={this.props.onAdd} isRemoval={false} />

Another thing that might come up is a mismatch between track and tracks.

Aaahh Thanks for this! It worked!

7,Jamming Feature Request - Playlist Fetch,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,3,"
I am trying to retrieve Spotify Playlists.
I have the API up and running fine. But When I try to load it to state I get this error -
TypeError: util_Spotify__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6_.Spotify.getPlaylistList() is undefined
Here is the code-
In Spotify.js -
getPlaylistList() {
        accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
        Spotify.getUserId()
        .then(userId => {
            return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`, {
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
                }
            });
        })
        .then(response => {
            const jsonResponse = response.json();
            console.log(jsonResponse);
            return jsonResponse;
        })
        .then(jsonResponse => {
            if (!jsonResponse.items) {
                return [];
            }

            console.log(jsonResponse.items);
            return jsonResponse.items.map(playlist => ({
                id: playlist.id,
                name: playlist.name
            }));
        });
    },

In App.js -
  getPlaylistList() {
    Spotify.getPlaylistList().then(playlist => {
      this.setState({
        playlistList: playlist
      })
    });
  }

....

  componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
      this.getPlaylistList().then(playlistList => {
        this.setState({playlistList: playlistList});
      });
    });
  }

If I do a simple Spotify.getPlaylist() call, then console.log shows a good return. So it has something to do with setting the state… Any ideas? Loosing my mind!!
I might add that “this” is also bound to the new method.
","
Further investigation has found that it is not setState( ) that breaks the code, but simply attaching  a .then()… Why this is happening is well beyond my scope of understanding and I’m struggling to find similar cases on the web.

Problem solved. Although not understood.
Despite the error message and how it worked under certain conditions. The overall fault was in the way I was utilising my getUserId() method.

Hi all,
First comment I’m posting looking for help, so please let me know if I make any mistakes in these protocols as well. I’ve gone through the Jammming app with the video tutorial and I’m having trouble getting the search function to work. I’ve searched for other threads and tried their solutions but no luck. Mostly ‘map’ and ‘then’ are both returning as undefined as I try different bug fixes.

You haven’t set a redirect Uri…
const redirectUri = ' '

It is empty. Also missing a semi-colon.

For some reason I found that my code didn’t like having my URL endpoints multi-line. Try making yours single-line too and report back.
Edit: Specifically -
const accessURL = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${clientID}
            &response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectURI}`;

Try -
const accessURL = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${clientID}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectURI}`;

Hello codecademy community!
Hope you guys are well.
I have finished all the projects in the React Module, and now I was trying to do some stuff by myself, following what we have learned in the Yelp and Spotify project, but I have encountered one big problem for example with the Yelp project.
When we search for a business and this is not found in the API of Yelp, the app directly crashes. I’m trying to do something similar with the Openweather API, and after reading many resources, I cannot find a clear answer on how to handle bad requests in React, and apply it to the project.
Sharing with you my code for the Yelp project for example. How would you handle bad request in the project?

Hello, I have the exact same issue ~ I have tried as a last resort to copy the code but it still doesn’t work.

I think in SearcgBar the search button probably doesn’t have a onClick attribute. So nothing happens when you click it. I’m trying to find the step where it tells you to do that, but I can’t. I just logically added onClick = {this.search} to that button and it seemed to work.
Anyone know which step we missed that included this?

Thank you. That was helpful

Same here! I think somehow the process video missed the step of onClick={this.search} for the search button!

Yes that fixed it!!! Thank you. Really nice that it also works after sitting behind a computer for more then 12 hours… \o/

Hello, I am REALLY STRUGGLING with this jammming app. I finished it and when I tried to perform saving to spotify , it create the playlist name BUT not add the songs there I was checking the code twice but I can’t realize which is the reason because the app saving the track to the playlist created. Sorry guys but I am really newbie coding.

Facing similar issues. Maybe you and I have the same problem - elaborating for help. Spotify API throwing a 401 error while retrieving userId.
As per https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#response-status-codes ,
401 error code is :
Unauthorized - The request requires user authentication or, if the request included authorization credentials, authorization has been refused for those credentials.
whereas i am passing the correct header with accessToken because rest of the functions like search are working.
Please help!!!

Im having the same problem with the Original Poster, but yours @kushalsogani is a different issue.
Check out your headers object. An object is always in the form of key : value pair(s)
Try:
return fetch(""https://api.spotify.com/v1/me"", { headers: headers })


You’ll have to post your code for help.  Too many variables it could be otherwise.

I actually managed to fix it, forgot to include “spotify.com” to the url… felt so stupid 
Can post code if @jpiazza37 still  has that issue

Hey all, I am struggling with the same thing. The last POST method throws a 404 error. ‘Something is not found’, but I do not get what. I checked and I get an array of trackUris, accessToken. Is there something wrong in the code? This is the error i get:

image1119×33 3.57 KB

P.S.When I enter the search term for the first time and press Search, the tracklist populates but then the page reloads itself and the tracklist stays empty. Instead, the page link changes with extensions of access_token and expires_in. Only after typing the term again and pressing Search, the tracklist populates again and stays as expected. Is there some connection here with this strange behaviour?
 savePlaylist(name, trackUris) {
        if (!name || !trackUris.length) {
            return;
        }

        const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
        const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` };
        let userId;
        console.log(trackUris);
        console.log(accessToken);

        return fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me', { headers: headers }
        ).then(response => response.json()
        ).then(jsonResponse => {
            userId = jsonResponse.id;
            return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`, {
                headers: headers,
                method: 'POST',
                body: JSON.stringify({ name: name })
            }).then(response => response.json()
            ).then(jsonResponse => {
                const playlistId = jsonResponse.id;
                return fetch(`­https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists/${playlistId}/tracks`,
                    {
                        headers: headers,
                        method: 'POST',
                        body: JSON.stringify({ uris: trackUris }) 
                    })
            })
        })
    }


@apalaio Hi! Can you elaborate on the spotify.com addition to the url? Can you, please, post the code with the change you made? Thanks!

I resolved the issue via Stackoverflow. The video tutorial for this project uses outdated POST method to add tracks. See the answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60747151/spotify-web-api-why-is-the-newly-created-playlist-not-populated-with-chosen-so

[quote=“scriptace90348, post:6, topic:456055”]
n I enter the search term for the first time and press Sea

Thanks  I will try this the next days , i will keep you posted

Thanks for this mate!

Thank you!! This solved my issue and now the songs actually appear in the playlist along with the title.

16,Ravenous part 4 problem,"FAQ,React.js",general,2,"
Hi! I finished the ravenous project, however, I have a problem with the app.
Even though the app runs without error the search and the Let’s go button doesn’t work.
I double-checked the SearchBar.js, Yelp.js, App.js, and BusinessList.js files, and I did not found the problem.
Please can you help me to identify where the problem might be?
Thanks!

Have you tried opening the developer tools to see if there are errors in the console? You’ll need to identify where the disconnect is happening, whether it’s in the component or the Yelp request.

Hi, welcome to the forums.
The backticks for code formatting need to be on the lines immediately before and after your code, not inline with the first/last line of code; otherwise, Markdown misinterprets the formatting and doesn’t show it correctly. (FYI).
The is telling you that it can’t call the .map() method of undefined, which looks to me like this.props.businesses might be the item which is undefined.
Look at where that’s being set, you might find your error. 

Hi, thanks for your answer and the tips.
Ii’s defined in the App component but not sure what the error is. I posted the code above, in case you can check.
Thanks

I am experiencing the same issue.

This is usually a cause of this problem.




Why isn't string interpolation working? (Check for backticks) JavaScript FAQ


    Why isn’t my interpolation working: 
console.log(‘My name is {myName}. My favorite city is {myCity}.’); 
The syntax looks right. It just prints the literal characters ${myName} without reading them as a variable. 
It seems to be bugged. If I type it, the console doesn’t recognise the variable as a variable, but as a string. If I copy and paste it, it recognises it as a variable - even though, to me, it appears as the same text.
  

In the code we are trying to generate/create custom URLs using fixed string portions (that don’t change) and combining them with variables (that are dynamic) that are converted to meaningful values and joining them altogether through string interpolation to give a custom URL (http).
And you should be using console.log(response) just before return response.json(); to check something is actually being returned from Yelp.

19,Ravenous - Part 4 : Solution additional features,"FAQ,React.js",,5,"
Hello,
Would that be possible to get the answers or some hints for the additional features to implement as part of step #28 of part 4 of the Ravenous project?
I am struggling to apply several of these features!
Thanks a lot.
*** Edit ***
Here are my answers:

Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab

<div className=""Business-information"">
                    <div className=""Business-address"">
                        <a href={urlToSearch} target='_blank'>{business.address}</a>
                        <p>{business.city}</p>
                        <p>{business.state} {business.zipCode}</p>


Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab

<div className=""Business"">
                <div className=""image-container"">
                    <a href={business.url} target='_blank'><img src={business.imageSrc} alt='' /></a>
                </div>


Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again

  handleSortByChange(sortByOption) {
    this.setState({
      sortBy: sortByOption
      }, () => {
      this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
    });
  }


Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)

    this.sortByOptions = {
      'Best Match': 'best_match',
      'Highest Rated': 'rating',
      'Most Reviewed': 'review_count',
      'Distance From': 'distance',
    };


Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking

Not found yet

Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input

Not found yet
","
Here is how I solved the enter key, but I still haven’t figured out the autocomplete.
In SearchBar.js I created a new method:
    handleKeyPress(event) {
      if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
      }
    }

In SearchBar.js I called that method on the input fields. If you press enter in any of the input fields it will run that code.
<input placeholder=""Search Businesses"" onChange={this.handleTermChange} onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress} />
<input placeholder=""Where?"" onChange={this.handleLocationChange} onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress} />


Your solution for re-querying Yelp when the sortBy option changes worked almost perfect for me, but I added some conditional logic – otherwise, if you remove text from the fields and click on a different sort-by option, the app crashes.
So it looks like this:
 handleSortByChange(sortByOption) {         this.setState({             sortBy: sortByOption             }, () => {                 if (this.state.term && this.state.location) {                 this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);             }});          }
I know this topic is old but the React forum seems pretty dead compared to JavaScript and some of the other ones…

Does anyone have any hints for the autocomplete part?

Hi, I used the Google Maps API for the autocomplete functionality. It took a while to figure out and I’m not totally confident I went about it the right way, as I’m now updating the search location in the SearchBar component using document.getElementById() on the location  element instead of the handleLocationChange() method. But that was the only way I could get it to work, as the “onChange” event handler doesn’t seem to recognize the selected autocompleted location as a “change” (it only registers the text typed manually.) It does work, though.
Can someone let me know if there is a better way to do this?
Apart from that, the other additional features seem to be working just fine.

Why the original codecademy example of JAMMING which is here
Starts working after the second search click ?
I thought it was only my bug 
","
Hi Yves!
There is this thread here in the forum:
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/jammming-page-refresh-after-first-song-search/463075/2
But I thought that this happens because acces token is not required until you click search the first time, which it could be solved by calling to search() when it loads the page, but don’t know how to do it, and I’m not sure this is the reason.
Anyway we may solve it while working in the next step Feature Request: Jammming
I’ve just open this thread on the forum to share our work
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/feature-request-jammming/486290

Blockquote
happy coding! 


You can run an empty search the first time, which will reload the page and allow you to search with no problems. Knowing this, I chose to force an empty search automatically when the page loads by adding the following code to the App component:
 componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener('load', Spotify.search(''));
  }

This has the added benefit of bringing up the login screen automatically when the page loads if you are not already logged in.

I found an easyer solution placing    Spotify.getAccessToken(); in App.js just after the imports.
Thank you anyway.

Hello! The search triggers an event and you can use event.preventDefault() in your event handler.
Hope that helps!

21,Jammming after every search page reloads data vanishes,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",5,"
I completed the Jamming project and was able to build it with surge. Here is the link to App:
Jammming-App
My issue is that after a user authenticates their Spotify account and then refreshes the page, the first search results in a list of songs that then vanishes(even the tracks added to playlist) when I search for the second time. All of the songs show up as they should from there on out. Only after a user refreshes the page and tries to search again does stuff vanish or the page refreshes itself. Even when I try to save the playlist the page refreshes and nothing happens.
I have checked the entire code and was unable to figure it out.
Is there a way to avoid it?

Hi @b_ma I also have the same problem and I think I have seen a few posts about it. If you find the solution please let me know and I will do the same!
Cheers!

Post on Stackflow, bottom part of the first post talks about refresh problem and possible fix.
I just found this. It talks about an API change, unable to test this myself atm.

Hi all,
I am running into the same issue http://save2spotify.surge.sh
and I can’t find the solution.
In addition, have you noticed that the playlistname doesn’t revert back to ‘New Playlist’ after saving a playlist even though the savePlaylist() method has a setState to update it? Any ideas how or why?

One problem solved: reseting the playlistname after saving a playlist:

replace initial state in App.js with ‘New Playlist’; and
in Playlist.js replace defaultValue=‘New Playlist’ in <input…> with value={this.props.playlistName}

In React.js we have to use className instead of class. It’s possible that this is preventing the CSS from rendering properly. Also, I formatted your code, so we can see the embedded HTML. For future posts, please review How do I format code in my posts?

Thank you midlingner for your inputs. After taking care of the className issue. I’m still getting the same response from the webpage which means all the options get selected when I click on one. Is there something I need to check on again?

I changed this in renderSortByOptions
let sortByOptionValue = this.sortByOptions[this.sortByOptions];
to
let sortByOptionValue = this.sortByOptions[sortByOption];
which fixed the problem for me. Looking at your code, it should fix the problem for you, too.

Hello, @aurore, and welcome to the forums!
When you see a TypeError: Cannot read property ‘whatever’ of undefined, the place to start looking is where ‘whatever’ is attached to should have been defined. In this case, ‘then’ is being called on something that is undefined. The something is the return value of Spotify.savePlaylist(). So, we need to look at the savePlaylist() function in the Spotify component. I see a typo in that function. If you need a hint, try looking for the word, ‘hearders’. 

Thank you so much @midlindner, I feel a little bit silly now ;-).

In App.js, your use of setState is wrong.
setState is a function, not a property of this. 
// correct usage
this.setState({
   ""key"" : ""new value""
});

Everything else looks fine, though I have no idea why you’re importing the SearchBar component into the Yelp.js file…

I’m having and issue and I cannot understand how or why.
So There is this component:

import Track from '../Track/Track'

class TrackList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
    <div className=""TrackList"">

          })
        }
    </div>
          );
    }
};  


export default TrackList;

And there is this:
import React from 'react';
import './PlayList.css';
import TrackList from '../TrackList/TrackList'

class PlayList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
    <div className=""Playlist"">
        <input defaultValue= {'New Playlist'}/>
          <TrackList tracks={this.props.playlistTracks} />
        <button className=""Playlist-save"">SAVE TO SPOTIFY</button>
    </div>
          );
        }
};  


export default PlayList;

The page wont render but throw an error saying that:  “Cannot read property ‘map’ undefined” unless I remove the  component from the PlayList Component. No idea what to do, please help!
","
You could do a conditional, or a try/catch, so that you’re not inadvertently calling map on undefined items.

I’m not sure I can follow this. In my understanding I should have no undefined items since I’m maping throug and array of objects and all of them are defined. If I dont render a Tracklist component in PlayList than it can read all of the objects and props without any of them being undefined. Could you also help me with the try/catch, how to implement it here? Thanks
Edit: after saving the files vs code says that its been compiled successfully…

Great that it runs!

In my understanding I should have no undefined items since I’m maping throug and array of objects and all of them are defined

Then the other logical option would be that you’re traversing the array incorrectly. Either way you’d need to log outputs to catch exactly what kind of misstep it would have been (even if the case is already fixed).
More info on try… catch: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch

Hey, it’s me again, its not running and I feel competely lost. Its still the cannot read property map of undefined but only when I try to render a TrackList component in PlayList…
Also when I try to add a try…catch like this:
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';
import Track from '../Track/Track'

class TrackList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""TrackList"">   
          try {
                this.props.tracks.map(track => {
                  return <Track track={track} key={track.id}/>
                  }) 
          } catch (error) {
            
          }
      </div> 
       
          );
    }
};  


export default TrackList;


It won’t print anything useful to the console…

Are you able to see the tracklist? If I were trying to do this I’d want to have a look at that just to know how to tackle the problem.

I can see it in react dev tools with all the assigned props and all. So the component recieves the needed arrays that its looping through.

Maybe you can try to make a dummy script with the same functionality and just a smaller sample size (a list of 4 items with two properties {name} and {id})) to help you catch where you’re going wrong.

Yeah, I retyped everything that got passed down to certain elements in App.js and its now working, closed a solid 25 open tabs. FeelsGoodMan. Thanks for helping me

Hey @charleskallick4619, The error message is basically saying that track.artist is undefined. You are using track.**artist**  instead of track.artist**s**. Also, the instructions say ""Artist - returned as track.artist**s**[0].name.
I hope this will help you!

Should be using console.log() to debug/check your code if you get stuck and compare with what you are expecting to see.

Hello!
I am also having the same issue. When I check the React Components tab on the dev tools, it states that ‘tracks’ is a defined prop:
image597×578 17.8 KB
However when I log the value
class Tracklist extends React.Component {

    render() {
        return (
            <div className=""TrackList"">
                
                {console.log(this.props.tracks)}
            </div>
        )

    }
}

It first acknowledges the props, then renders again and determines them undefined.

Are you seeing a similar issue?

Never mind @khronar I solved the error, but I don’t exactly remember how I solved it. It might work for you if you comment out the <TrackList /> component is Playlist.js

I literally just solved it that way! Thanks!

You’re welcome @khronar

I see you found a solution to your problem, I’d just like to add some context to how I fixed the problem.
For some reason when you have more than one instance of a component being rendered and one of those components doesn’t pass any props or state, it will confuse any functions on that component that does have a prop.
For example you’re passing the an array from App to TrackList but Playlist was also passing no props to TrackList therefore confusing it.  Hopefully this helps 

You are right @jckofc

Thank you! I understand the problem now, but why does this happen? Shouldn’t there be a way to avoid this?

Hi @bernardoquina. I don’t exactly know how this happened, maybe because the <TrackList /> components were conflicting with each other(props on one & no props on the other.)

That was the problem!!!
comment out the  component in Playlist.js.

You have literally ended my mental breakdown as I was not even able to get ahold of any solution, thanks!

Heym thanks for the detailed answer, I will keep that in mind!

Hi, when working on TopNumber.js in this exercise, I found some code confusing and couldn’t find answers about it. Can someone help me out why ‘highest’
in the constructor state object acts like a string with the quotes, but on the other hand referring the state using this.state.highest which does not include quotes?
export class TopNumber extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { 'highest': 0 };
  }

  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps.number > this.state.highest) {
      this.setState({
        highest: nextProps.number

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        Top Number: {this.state.highest}

    );

I will be very grateful if someone can talk about what’s going on here!

Javascript is just a little loose like that… I’d love to know the reason why too. Try this code out:
let obj = { first_property:    'value_1',   
            5:                 'value_2',   
            'stringProperty':  'value_prop'}; 

console.log(obj.first_property) // outputs  value_1
console.log(obj[5])             // outputs  value_2
console.log(obj.stringProperty) // outputs  value_prop

N.B. if it were named 'string property' you saying obj.string property throws an error.

Thanks a lot! I’ve tried out your code and it helps me to get more understanding about the usage now

Getting Started · Create React App
Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React





I’m a little disappointed that of the dozens of posts for help almost none of them have any responses from Codecademy…

posts do sometimes slip through the cracks
you do understand by now that -g means you want to install the package globally (for all users)? This does require “administrator” privileges indeed.
you can also install the package only for your current user, then you don’t need special permission

I wasted an hour digging around online when i should have just gone with whitepk86’s answer. Codecademy should update their instructions at https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/ravenous-part-one/articles/how-to-create-a-react-app to reflect this difficulty that seems to be very commonly encountered

I had the same problem. @whitepk86 's solution worked for me as well, thanks!
@stetim94 I do have admin privileges; is there a step you have to take before the Terminal will recognize this? Also, I don’t remember learning about -g yet in Codecademy.  An update to the article, as flexidex suggests would be appreciated. (new users can only mention 2 people)




 ncarnold:

I do have admin privileges; is there a step you have to take before the Terminal will recognize this?


yes, you need to run the command as root (admin). the Sudo program is often used for this

Got it! Thanks for your help!

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.

Use npm install <pkg> afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

what is in the log? 

Hi, I tried this without the ‘-g’ to avoid having to log in as “root”. It still threw up (fewer) errors. I then tried the next ""create-react-app "" command - but “-bash: create-react-app: command not found” was returned.
In the end I used the “npx create-react-app my-app” command instead which worked.
Agree perhaps these instructions need a little update.

I also had the same issue.
I started by googling the “npm WARN checkPermissions” error and found this link:

How to fix the ""Missing write access"" error when using npm
Quickly solve this annoying problem when installing global packages using npm






it included some commands i wasn’t familiar with, so i just went with the solution @whitepk86 suggested, and it seemed to work, though there were some installation errors showing in the terminal.
What’s the difference between npm and npx?

i don’t find this a good article. You need a very good reason to change a system directory permissions to your users permission. This doesn’t really solve the problem, given another user (*nix system are multi-user) still has a problem
if you want to install a package globally, give yourself the right permissions for the installation (don’t change directory owner) or install the package for your user only (non-globally)

I’m actually on this right now and before installing anything I was googling what the command did and I ran into these two links
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
and
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
I’m trying to make sure I don’t do out of date things cause some of the lessons are outdated and needs updating.
How did you solve your issues?

@cssplayer91911
Most updated create-react-app command is:
npx create-react-app heggy-react-app
Note: “heggy-react-app” will be your name of react app.
Note: if you get an error “A template was not provided.” then you have an older version of create-react-app installed globally.
You must remove old version of create-react-app globally first, in order for npx create-react-app heggy-react-app to work properly.


Go to your terminal and type: cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules
Note: This folder contains the node_modules folder from user root directory which contains any globally installed modules including create-react-app.


Delete “create-react-app” folder from “/usr/local/lib/node_modules”


npx create-react-app heggy-react-app works


Here is resource for more info: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8085#issuecomment-562331043

Also to create the react app directory, make the directory in your filesystem (my-app) , cd into it (cd my-app) and then run npx create-react-app *.
That will make the app right in your current folder

Thank you for sharing!!

Thank you for posting this solution. It helped me solve my problem (the same you encountered) quickly and without a lot of stress.

On your github the savePlaylist() method saves the token that is generated into a variable called aToken.
Which is not used in your headers variable like you have in the search() method.

38,Changes to create-react-app have broken the Ravenous Part 3 Instructions,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
Hi all, I’m working on Ravenous Part 3, a lesson in the React.js module. Link:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/ravenous-part-three/projects/setting-searchbar-state
In step 16, the instructions ask the user to include a method called ‘searchYelp()’ under the App class declaration, in the App.js file.
The latest version of create-react-app has modified the template of App.js so that he App class declaration is now a function. See the before and after:
APP.JS in previous create-react-app version
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
    <div className=""App"">
      <h1>ravenous</h1>
      <SearchBar searchYelp={searchYelp('pizza', 'new york', 'best_match')} />
      <BusinessList businesses={businesses} />
    </div>
    )
  }
};

export default App;

APP.JS in latest create-react-app version
function App() {
  return (
    <div className=""App"">
      <h1>ravenous</h1>
      <SearchBar searchYelp={searchYelp('pizza', 'new york', 'best_match')} />
      <BusinessList businesses={businesses} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Trying to add the searchYelp() method to the App function declaration breaks the compiler, so I’m not sure how to include it and progress with the lesson.
Any ideas?
","
I’ve figured it out. Manually changing the App function declaration to an App class declaration will  fix the problem. Would be good if Codecademy could update the instructions to reflect this though…

I cannot truly start the React Development Setup and Ravenous: Part 1 course because, when i create the folder and start the npm, the following happens, meaning i need to delete 2 hard to specify files that i didnt need to remove. Can anyone help me?
""ravenous.1@0.1.0 start C:\Users\Robin\ravenous.1

react-scripts start

There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.
The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:
“babel-loader”: “8.1.0”
Don’t try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of babel-loader was detected higher up in the tree:
C:\Users\Robin\node_modules\babel-loader (version: 8.0.6)
Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.
If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.
To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
Delete node_modules in your project folder.
Remove “babel-loader” from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.

In most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.
If this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:


If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.
This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.


Check if C:\Users\Robin\node_modules\babel-loader is outside your project directory.
For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.


Try running npm ls babel-loader in your project folder.
This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed babel-loader.


If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.
P.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above  We hope you find them helpful!

43,React Development Setup and Ravenous: Part 1 Failed to Compile,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",9,"
./src/components/App/App.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './src/logo.svg' in '/Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/App'

everytime i hit npm start into the terminal i get this failed to compile message and I am unsure how to fix this.
","
forgot to mention this is from the React Development Setup and Ravenous: Part 1 module and inside the project Create Projects & Components

Hello @ketchell21! Can you show me your app.js file? The error might be occurring there…

Sure! I was able to actually work through the project and I happened to watch the get help video. At the end of the video the guy actually deleted this line of code that was causing this problem claiming that we weren’t actually using this logo so we didn’t need it. But I am still curious what the problem was just for learning purposes. I did add the line of code back that was causing the problem just so you could see
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import logo from './src/logo.svg'
import SearchBar from '/Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/SearchBar/SearchBar';
import BusinessList from '/Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/BusinessList/BusinessList';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className=""App"">
  <h1>ravenous</h1>
  <SearchBar />
  <BusinessList />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;


As you can tell by the import searchbar and the import business list I was having problems using relative paths and had to use the whole path. Not sure why but this also might have something to do with why the logo was not working




 ketchell21:

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import logo from './src/logo.svg'
import SearchBar from '/Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/SearchBar/SearchBar';
import BusinessList from '/Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/BusinessList/BusinessList';

class App extends React.Component {
  return (
    <div className=""App"">
      <h1>ravenous</h1>
      <SearchBar />
      <BusinessList />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;



Here I also modified (corrected) your code to use class App extends React.Component instead of function App() {}. You will need to also add the render method before the return statement
P.S. You can paste the corrected code from above, but make sure to add your render method!!!

Hi there, welcome back to the forum.
The error is quite clear about what is the issue. Your App.js is looking for a logo file at the relative path ./src/logo.svg.
This path is relative to App.js, so would evaluate to /Users/Josh/ravenous/src/components/App/src/logo.svg which I imagine doesn’t exist.
The first few steps for Ravenous Part 1 has you move the “App” component from the src folder to a newly created subdirectory inside another new directory called components, and then asks you to update the paths.
You’ve not updated the path for the logo, that’s all. As you say, it isn’t actually used anywhere so you could just remove the line. Alternatively, you could seize the opportunity to practice working with relative paths as you seem to struggle with them (based on the non-relative paths to SearchBar and BusinessList). 

Thank you appreciate it!

Thanks for taking the time to reply. I’ll definitely do that!

Have you already changed or added your surge domain in the Spotify API redirect uri from your Spotify Dashboard?
I got to depploy my jamming web but, when I changed to localhost and tryed to depploy again I couldn’t change the redirect uri in Spotify API Dashboard. It seems it doesn’t admit many words.
I’ll try to clean my cookies in my browser and try again.

I ran into the same problem. Have you found a solution?

Same here, did you figure it out?

Unfortunately, no. I stopped trying.

I managed to fix it; you have to change the redirect URI on both the online Spotify app and at the top of Spotify.js to ‘http://localhost:3000/callback/’

No it doesn’t work…

that’s a shame 
good luck!

45,Jammming step 99 changing redirect to http://localhost:3000/callback/ solves the redirect error BUT WHY?,"FAQ,React.js",advanced-react,1,"
I ran into a similar problem as many others. When using surge to deploy the Jammming app and following the directions: change the redirect URI on both the Spotify dashboard and in your Spotify.js I got an authentication error because the URI was wrong.
Reading several topics about it, the solution is to change whatever.surge.sh to localhost:3000/callback/ in both locations. It works. But nobody explains WHY it works.
Can someone please explain this to me?
For reference:
let accessToken;
const clientID = '7432ea43240b4ad1bf6c309a28f2723f';
//const redirectURI = ""mysuperappJammming.surge.sh""; <-- THIS DOES NOT WORK
// I tried it with http:// and https:// as well

const redirectURI = ""http://localhost:3000/callback/""; // <-- THIS DOES WORK

const Spotify = {

46,Ravenous part 3 - searchYelp method in App.js?,"FAQ,React.js",components-interacting,3,"
I am having trouble understanding the interaction between the components.
It seems more logical to me to have the searchYelp() method in SearchBar.js instead we have to put it in App.js
Would it be possible to have the searchYelp() method in SearchBar.js and how would you do that?
Can anyone provide an explanation?
","
Hi there.
I am fairly new to React, so my understanding and explanation may be wrong, but…
Having the searchYelp() function defined in the App component is, I think, an example of the programming pattern you’re introduced to in the Child Components Update their Siblings’ Props lesson.
The App component is stateful, and its state contains the property businesses which is where the list of businesses we want to display is stored. As a result, if we want to update that array, we need to set the state of the App component - meaning that we need to call this.setState() from inside the App component.
For this reason, searchYelp() is defined in App.js and the keyword this is bound to App.
The searchYelp() function is handed down to the SearchBar component, because the SearchBar is where the input fields are. When you actually do the search, the searchYelp() function gets its parameters from the SearchBar component but it changes the state of it’s parent - the App component.
Changing the state of App triggers React to render the component again, to reflect any changes. SearchBar won’t have changed, but the value of this.state.businesses which is passed to the BusinessList component as a prop has changed. BusinessList gets rendered again, with the data returned from Yelp.
Again, I’m new to React, but I don’t think there’s any way of directly accessing the state of the parent component from a child component. That’s why it’s necessary to pass a callback function as a prop, with this appropriately bound. This is why I don’t think you could put the searchYelp() function in the SearchBar, because it would no longer be able to update the state for the App component which is where the BusinessList component gets its data from.
I might come back and rework this explanation, as I’m not sure I’ve explained it particularly well… but I’m still grappling with exactly how React works myself. 

Thanks a lot for your quick reply. It all sounds very logical.
On top of trying to understand React I am also dealing with a language barrier from English to my native language Dutch.
Should you find your answers needs updating please let me know. But it all sounds pretty good to me.

Hi,
I got the exactly same Warning code.
I tried to resolve the issue.
The Warning(this is not an error) occured  in the BusinessList.js file:
My first code was:
{
     this.props.businesses.map((business, index) => 
          <Business business={business}/>)
}

I needed to add a unique key property to the (Business /) and it is resolve the issue.


Solution
{
      this.props.businesses.map((business, index) => 
           <Business key={index} business={business}/>)
}



React always expects every list to have a key prop passed into it, i’d use the index of the map function

Thank you for posting the solution

Short answer, no. However I’ve put out a call for help with your problem.


Thanks for posting a link to the project, so we know what you’re working on; however, that doesn’t allow us to see your code.
Are you able to upload the code you’re working with somewhere (like GitHub), or post it here (correctly formatted) so we can see what you’re running? That would help us to look at the problem.

54,Stacking filters on a state and reverting back to initial state,"FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
I am building a page mimicking a marketplace where you buy stuff online. Issue I am facing is how can I stack filters on the displayed results which I have saved in a state.
for example price range filter is applied then product type is applied on top of that then size etc and each filter reduces the number of displayed results but then when the user undo one of the filters then I need to update the already filtered results accordingly, if he undo all of filters then I am basically going back to the initial results.
My idea is to create another state (tempFiltredState) which basically takes the initial state and apply whatever filter was used on it  then I can render this tempFiltredState  when it is true, however I can’t find the logic to get this done. my idea is to have one big filters wrapper function that gets triggered when any filter is clicked.
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react'
const[pricefilter,SetPriceFilter]=useState(false)
const[menonlyfilter,SetMenOnlyFilter]=useState(false)
const[shoesonlyfilter,SetShoesOnlyFilter]=useState(false)
const[tempfiltredstate,SettempFiltredState]=useState([])
const[allresults,SetAllResults]=useState(project.apiResults)

// filters job will be to pass values of filters and set filter state to true

55,Unable to get Yelp API outside US - Ravenous Part 4,"FAQ,React.js",,5,"
Guys, having a problem signing up to Yelp for the Ravenous part 4 project. I am not from the US and a quick Google search says that yelp is probably blocking my ip because I am not from the US.
The specific error when trying to sign up…

Oops, Yelp is overworked right now.

Solutions given by a Google search are to use a proxy server.
However, I am wondering if someone can share a non-used yelp API credentials from a temp email account or something that I can use for this project.
Any ideas? Tks.

Chances are, if your IP is being blocked from signing up for Yelp, it’ll be blocked from making API requests, regardless of the credentials…
See this CNET article for information on VPNs, which will allow you to use a proxy server from another location.

Thanks @825orion. Looks like the only option. I sped read through the article and sounds like a plan. I’ll try to find one that allows a free subscription for a few days since it doesn’t make sense to pay just for a single exercise .

Same issue for me… If codecademy sees this, pls dont use APIs that block foreign IP adresses for future projects… now I cant complete it 
it would be nice if yall could put an alternative API to use to complete the project, with alternate instructions and stuff to go along with it.

Did you been able to solve the issue? If you have solved the issue can you explain that to me?

Dear jsamuel2008,
I also had some issues installing ‘npm react’ - I do not remember if the error was the same as yours. The solution for me was to prepound the command given by codecademy with   sudo. You will be asked for admin password. Hope it helps!

I figured it out but thank you.

I’d hazard a guess that this.props.tracks is undefined, hence when you’re attempting to chain the .map() method on to it you’re getting an error.
Do you perhaps have a <TrackList /> element somewhere which is missing an attribute?

I was having a frustrating error on this and was about to ask for advice, but I just figured it out!
To address your issue, I put the onKeyPress event listeners on the two inputs instead of the submit button, since that’s where the keypress is happening. I’m not finding that I need the mount and unmount methods. Here’s my code:
handleSearch(event) {
        this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
        event.preventDefault();
    }

    handleKeyPress(event) {
        if (event.charCode == 13) {
        this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
        event.preventDefault();
        }
    };

  render() {
        return (
            <div className=""SearchBar"">
                <div className=""SearchBar-sort-options"">
                    <ul>
                    {this.renderSortByOptions()}
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div className=""SearchBar-fields"">
                    <input onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress} onChange={this.handleTermChange} placeholder=""Search Businesses"" />
                    <input onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress} onChange={this.handleLocationChange} placeholder=""Where?"" />
                </div>
                <div onClick={this.handleSearch} 
                    className=""SearchBar-submit"">
                    <a>Let's Go</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

By the way, for anyone getting a TypeError (‘cannot display undefined property of props’ or something like that) … make sure you have your binding statement in the constructor… Took me way too long to debug that one. 

Hey @loraxicon thanks for sharing that, it worked for me too!

I’ve looked and hunt for hours for a typo or a silly mistake but I can’t see / understand why my Spotify.savePlaylist is undefined…
Please help, I’m going to become completely mad…
Many many thanks a lot in advance for your help.
","
When I just looked, I got “TypeError: Cannot read property ‘then’ of undefined” when I try and save an empty Playlist which makes sense.
So I have added a check which pops an alert window if trackUris is empty, to my savePlaylist().
You do not need the popup, just stopping the Spotify.savePlaylist() from running by checking is enough to stop it faulting.
I think you may have other problems, but this problem is not helpful.
savePlaylist = () => {
    const trackUris = this.state.playlistTracks.map((track) => track.uri);
    
	if (trackUris && trackUris.length) {
		Spotify.savePlaylist(this.state.playlistName, trackUris).then(() => {
			this.setState({
				playlistName: ""New Playlist"",
				playlistTracks: [],
			});
		});
	} else {
		alert(""Playlist empty"");
	}
};

Thanks a lot for your help Nessie.
I’ve added your if/else check and it’s actually throwing me an alert popup saying my playlist is empty.
I still have my 404 and 403 errors but the browser error don’t popup anymore.
What’s crazy is that I ended strictly copying every single line of code in the different steps of codecademy video tutorial…

I see in your second screenshot that interpolated http:// URL string has an undefined value which it should be getting back from querying Spotify in the Spotify.js and you also have 403 forbidden errors which are usually security (Authentication) related.
Your Spotify.JS looks ok to me, but I don’t know if you have been putting console.log’s on the input and output variables used by each fetch() stage to see if you are missing data at any point.
I think you may have a problem with Spotify itself tbh.
If I had this problem I would be deleting the Spotify App endpoint on the Dashboard and recreating another one and even creating an alternative Spotify account.

I copied your Spotify.js into a new file on my project and I was getting errors.
I found it was being caused the redirectUri;
// Spotify redirect URL
const redirectUri = 'http://localhost:3000';

It would not work until it had a trailing forward slash added at the end of the URL string (my version had it);
const redirectUri = ""http://localhost:3000/"";


Nice logic @nessie2015! Helped clear up the error I was running into.
Cheers!

Manage to fix it.

But i belive that on the video was showing only one dot, but anyway this is how it should look like I guess.

Yes I got the same thing - is it to do with changing more filepaths than just the one to App?

Hey I think I solved this by copying the logo.svg into components/App. Well for the moment it doesn’t look broken. Does that solve your problem too?

73,Feature Request: Jammming,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",3,"
I have been working on adding a few new features to Jammming project and my first goal is pulling a list of playlists from Spotify.
Here are the adjustments I made but it hasn’t been working as I hoped, can someone help?

Added an empty object of spotifyList array into src/App.js

Added componentDidMount method to call playlists when the first render is complete in src/App.js

Passed spotifyList state to SpotifyPlaylist component.

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      spotifyList: [],
    };
...
 async componentDidMount() {
    await Spotify.bringPlaylist().then(
      (spotifyList) => {
        this.setState({ spotifyList, loading: false });
      },
      (error) => {
        this.setState({ loading: false, error });
      }
    );
  }
...
render () return {
<SpotifyPlaylist onSearch={this.search} spotifyList={this.state.spotifyList} />

In the meantime, I’ve added below to Spotify.js to make a GET request:
bringPlaylist(){
    let userID;
    return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userID}/playlists`)
   .then(response=>{
    if (response.ok) {return response.json()};
    throw new Error('Request failed!');}
    ,networkError=>{console.log(networkError.message);}).then(jsonResponse=>{return jsonResponse;})
   }

","
Your fetch requests are missing the Authorization Headers that confirm to the Spotify who you are.
You should have them in your search() and savePlaylist() methods in Spotify.js.
And you need to retrieve the userID with a fetch first and then call another fetch to retrieve the playlists. This is almost identical to what savePlaylist() does.
const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` };
let userId;

return fetch(""https://api.spotify.com/v1/me"", {
      headers,
})
.then((response) => response.json())
.then((jsonResponse) => {

	userId = jsonResponse.id;
		
	return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`, {
		headers,
	})
	.then((response) => response.json())
	.then((jsonResponse) => {
		console.log(jsonResponse);
	})
});

This is assuming your URL is valid, I know you can POST to it because savePlaylist() uses it, I have not looked at Spotify API docs.

I had not tested this when posted this morning.
It does return an array of items[], each one a playlist.
async componentDidMount() {
	await Spotify.bringPlaylists();
}

bringPlaylists() {
	const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
	const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` };
	let userId;

	return fetch(""https://api.spotify.com/v1/me"", {
		headers,
	})
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((jsonResponse) => {
			userId = jsonResponse.id;

			return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`, {
			headers,
			})
				.then((response) => response.json())
				.then((jsonResponse) => {
					console.log(jsonResponse);
				});
		});

74,Ravenous Part 3: SOS please help!,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,3,"
I’m working on Ravenous Part 3 in the web developer path: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/ravenous-part-three/projects/setting-searchbar-state
I also have a few questions about this part of the project, as it seems to deviate quite a bit from the CC lessons on changing stateless components to stateful components. I’m pretty confused by it all.
In the lessons, we are instructed that a parent component should pass its state to a child component. But isn’t App the parent component in this case, as we import SearchBar into it? So shouldn’t it be the state of App that is the one which sets the state of SearchBar? The parent should then define a method that calls this.SetState, but again this is on SearchBar.
Now that the parent has defined a method which updates its state and has bound to it, the next step would be the parent passing that method down to a child, in render’s return statement. This happens in the render statement of App, but the previous steps of defining a method to update the state and bind to it all happen in SearchBar
If someone could explain why this is, I would be so grateful.
Also, on step 25 when I type in the search box the type of food I’m searching for and location, the statement does not appear in the console of my browser.
I have gone through the solution code and compared it to mine line by line, and they look exactly the same to me. I also tried copying and pasting the solution code into my code editor and tried again logging the message to the console, but still nothing.
I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem?

Hello,
I came to ask my own question and saw this post. Your code looks good. I do notice in the console your filter has some text in it. I would clear that filter and then see what you have.
In regard to your first question. I’m learning and trying to grasp/understand that myself, but wanted to at least offer a solution for the second part.
Happy coding,

That solved the console log problem, thank you so much!

You’ve included your code inside a blockquote rather than as preformatted text using the  </> button. That is preventing a few things like back ticks from showing up. Incidentally, if you can find where you are missing a back tick in your code, you may clear your error. The error message give you a hint of where to start looking for a problem.

in this case the error is not helping a lot, the return fetch has all the back ticks…

$ rg --count-matches '`' blah.js 
5

usually they come in pairs.

Thanks to some quick analysis by @ionatan, we know that your code has 5 back ticks in it. Look closely at this line:
return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`,

Notice how in your post everything following the // looks like a comment? If it were included in a string as it appears to be if you only examine that line, it should look like it does here in my post. But it doesn’t. Why would that be? Consider:
const pet = ""Riley""

console.log(`I took ${pet} to the vet today. The vet was great.)
console.log(`You should check out her website: https://worldsgreatestfakevetthisisnotreal.com`)

${playistId}


It seems you have a typo in your 2nd fetch url : {playistId} should be {playlistId}.

77,This.props is not a function. Passing methods as props?,"FAQ,React.js","react-components,general",5,"
Hi! I’m having a bit of an issue completing the Jammming project within the WebDev course (https://bit.ly/2TBz9xz), I’m about halfway through and I am getting the following error:
**TypeError: this.props.onAdd is not a function**
addTrack(){
var track = this.props.track;
this.props.onAdd(track);
};



Project Breakdown
1. addTrack() defined in <App /> and bound using this.addTrack = this.addTrack.bind(this);
2. passed to SearchResults via <SearchResults onAdd={this.addTrack} />
3. passed to Tracklist via <Tracklist onAdd={this.props.onAdd} />
4. passed to Track via <Track onAdd={this.props.onAdd} />
5. passed to a button via <button onClick={this.addTrack} />




Here is where the method is invoked in App.js
addTrack(track){
    var tracks = this.state.playlistTracks;
    if (tracks.find(savedTrack => savedTrack.id === track.id)){
    return;

    tracks.push(track);

Did you mean for it to be a function?
Did you define it yourself? If so that’s where the problem is right?
Or if you didn’t mean for it to be a function, don’t treat it like one
Or if it should should be a function, and you didn’t define it, then define it

Yes, the prop is meant to act as a function. It was defined as a method in the parent component. Aside from binding the method using this.example.bind(this) in the constructor, and passing it as a prop using <Example exampleProp={this.example}/>, is there anything else I need to do to properly define it as a function?
The method works fine within the first child component, I can pass it arguments like a regular method:
<div>
{this.props.example(""Example input"")}
</div>

but after being passed as a prop to a second child using <ExampleChild example={this.props.example} /> it stops working as a function and no longer accepts arguments.




 timwr:

Yes, the prop is meant to act as a function.


So where are you defining that prop? What makes you say that it’s there?



 timwr:

It was defined as a method in the parent component.


Okay, so far so good. Who’s that, tracklist?



 timwr:

return <Track onAdd={this.props.onAdd}


Yeah, it’s there. But who’s providing this.props.onAdd here then?



 timwr:

<Tracklist tracks={this.props.playlistTracks} />


… well, where is it?
So, there was supposed to be a function there, nobody defined it … define it… done?
I may very well be missing things because idk react, so you know better than me where it’s supposed to come from. Follow it.
Going one step further up, it appears again:
<Tracklist isRemoval={false} onAdd={this.props.onAdd} tracks={this.props.searchResults} />

Does that implicitly get included if you do not mention it in children? But if so, then why bothering mentioning it in any of the intermediaries, so I’m guessing, not? But idk.



 timwr:

it stops working as a function


Seems unlikely. More likely, you’re using a different value altogether.

I found it I did not bind the addTrack function thats way I got typeError

This “correct” answer is awful. It is basically saying that the point of this process is “that’s just how it’s done. Get used to it.” Wouldn’t it be more accurate to say something along the lines of “it helps maintain the readability of the code, and more accurately see the flow of the program.” ?

Hello! I have a question about .render() method.
A render method is a property whose  name  is  render , and whose  value  is a function.
How can I understand “value of the render method is a function”? And why render method here called as render function if its a method? Also I wanted to ask why do we use “return” in the method?
Thank you in advance
","
the MDN documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Defining_methods
formulates it better:

A method is a function associated with an object, or, simply put, a method is a property of an object that is a function.

Methods are also properties.



 dariyavolosh9:

Also I wanted to ask why do we use “return” in the method?


You have learned JS before starting reactJS, right? Well, we need to return what we want to render on the page.

Actually I always used console.log() in methods, so thats why I asked about using return in methods) I usually use return in functions and conole.log() in methods, so thats why I was confused

.log() logs something to the console.
return hands back data to the caller.
given the log method and return keyword achieve very different things, they are not interchangeable.

npm install -g create-react-app

Downloads and installs a copy globally (-g), in your user profile and it will be the current version
npm create-react-app my-app

Uses the local (global) copy to create your my-app.
npx create-react-app my-app

Creates the my-app with the latest version directly off the Github site with the current version.



GitHub



facebook/create-react-app
Set up a modern web app by running one command. Contribute to facebook/create-react-app development by creating an account on GitHub.





They recommend using
npx create-react-app my-app

I think its because it will always be the most up to date version when you use it. Local versions do not update unless you force them and can be out of date.

If you’ve previously installed  create-react-app  globally via  npm install -g create-react-app , we recommend you uninstall the package using  npm uninstall -g create-react-app  to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

83,I have a question about ReactDOM.render(),"FAQ,React.js",general,5,"
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/react-101-jsx-u/lessons/react-jsx-intro/exercises/reactdom-render-i
Hello everyone!
As we learned from this lesson, ReactDOM.render() takes first argument, creates a corresponding tree of nodes and than add this tree to the DOM. So why html file is not updated after rendering a JSX element?
Thank you in advance!
","
HTML has DOM, which is what you see on a webpage.
reactJS is written in Javascript. Javascript can manipulate the HTML DOM. However, DOM manipulation is expensive. That is where reactJS comes in, reactJS use a shadow or virtual DOM to optimize this process.

So when we manipulate HTML DOM with javascript, we actually add or change nodes in the DOM, so thats why this is not too fast. But react.js uses a virtual DOM, and the changes are added there, and these changes are rendered on the website with ReactDOM.render() without actually adding these nodes in the HTML file and in HTML DOM, and react.js updates only necessary part of the react DOM, not all the DOM, thats why using react.js is more effective and faster? (For example if we change node just using JavaScript it will update all the file, and when we use react.js it updates only nodes that were cnaged?) Do I understand it correctly?

Good, I like how you take thinking steps yourself trying to figure things out 
the .render() is only the initial mount.
The html is rendered by the browser, resulting in the DOM. This involves graphical rendering and more. Its a very complicated process. So we don’t manipulate the html file, but result of the file being rendered.
Of course reactJS will have to update the DOM, but by using the virtual DOM, reactJS minimizes interactions with the DOM.
I am sure there are good in-depth articles on how this works.

Thank you so much for your answer

Hello @factoradic … where are you? I replied 4 days ago!!!

The error message indicates that the cause of the error is on line 30:
tracks = tracks.filter(currentTrack => currentTrack.id !== tracks.id);

and you know that the error is connected to accessing the property id.
So what now? We have two hypotheses:


currentTrack.id causes the problem;

tracks.id causes the problem.

One of these variables have undefined value, which one? Do you have an idea how to check this? Maybe you could use debugger if you are familiar with developer console or simply use console.log statements to monitor what happens in your application, for example:
removeTrack(track) {
  let tracks = this.state.playListTracks;
  console.log(""Tracks:"", tracks);
  
  tracks = tracks.filter(currentTrack => {
    console.log(""currentTrack:"", currentTrack);
    return currentTrack.id !== tracks.id
  });

  this.setState({playListTracks: tracks});
}


never mind @factoradic I’m done with the Jammming project

85,"Why no parenthesis when using event Handler, but yes for other function calls?","FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
Regarding the “Random Color” Project for React Part I
At the end, there is a <Button> described as such: <Button	onClick={this.handleClick} light={this.isLight()} />
When <Button> uses this.isLight() it requires parenthesis, however the event handler does not use parens, it just has this.handleClick.
It is my understanding that this.functionName() is a call to the function and just this.functionName is a reference to the object for the function (at least in Python).
But I feel like it should be the same for both. Why is the syntax different here?

88,Ravenous Part 1 BusinessList Styling,"FAQ,React.js",jsx,4,"
Hey guys,
After I completed Rav part 1 all is set and done but for some reason my BusinessList components fail to load correctly, I checked it with react tools and the div containers for the pictures are perfectly fine and all but still the pictures that are loaded are so big.
I have checked 3 times the Business.css file as it is the rendered component inside the BusinessList JSX, but something is off since it fails to give the pictures height and width so it wont overlap the container.
image1920×1080 620 KB
I have worked through the part with the video too to triple check it.
My Business.js file:
import React from 'react';
import './Business.css';

const business = {
    imageSrc: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/ravenous/pizza.jpg',

Yeah well, managed to solve itm the problem was:
The excercise asked me to add this css to the App.css:
/* Universal Styles */

html {
  font-size: 18px;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 560px) {
  html {
    font-size: 15px;
  }
}

input:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Reusable Component - Image Container */

.image-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: #000;
}

.image-container img {
  width: 100%;
}

/* App Styles */

.App {
  font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  padding: .66rem 0;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #cca353;
  font-family: Poppins, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  color: #fff;
}

while in the solution the app.css contains this code:
/* Universal Styles */

html {
  font-size: 18px;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 560px) {
  html {
    font-size: 15px;
  }
}

input:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Reusable Component - Image Container */

.image-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: #000;
}

.image-container img {
  width: 100%;
}

/* App Styles */

.App {
  font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  padding: .66rem 0;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #cca353;
  font-family: Poppins, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  color: #fff;
}

Edit: After posting the two code it seems the absolute same to me, yet the first one fails to laod the images correctly, what could be the problem?

Hi @script4959091261! I saw your JSX & The “Business” component is probably overlapping because of the indentation of one of your closing  </div> tags. check the closing div tag & the h2 tag, the indentation is off there. Hope this helps!

Thank you for your answer.
Actually I opened the solution part and all I did was copy the App.css from there and after ctr v it worked, but I will check on the closing div tag as well!

Hey what’s up! Try checking the status response you are getting from the Yelp API in the network tab in the console. Also, try refreshing your API key. Hope this helps and good luck.

Nevermind, that didn’t work. I tried a new yelp API and still same error: GET 400(Bad Request).

Ok, that’s a step in the right direction. Now you know that your error is coming from how you are presenting the request to the API. Check the variables that are plugged in to the fetch method. I would recommend logging them to the console so you can see the info you are inputting to the request (maybe you have an undefined that is being passed in to the request or something of the sort). Additionally, here is my code for the fetch request which is working just fine:
  searchYelp(term, location, sortBy) {
    //Fetch info using CORS Anywhere API to bypass Cross Origin Resource Sharing restrictions and API Key
    return fetch(`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=${term}&location=${location}&sort_by=${sortBy}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`
      }
    })


Thank you for taking time to help. I tried logging the inputs that I had and they appeared normally in the order they should be term,location,sortBy. Also, I noticed I am only getting the GET 400 (Bad Request) error when I don’t type in one or more of the fields in the search bar. But when I type everything in It doesn’t function, but no error message in the console.

No worries. So if you don’t type all the fields you’ll get a 400 response because of the undefined variable in the API request. If you define all the fields I am assuming you are now getting a 200 (OK) response. I am pretty sure I am seeing your problem and it is in the if statement of the json response. Try logging the json response so you see why the if statement is resolving to false rather than true.

Hi there,
Did you resolve your problem?
I came across it as I have got a very similar error coming up.
Having looked through your Yelp.js I see that in your if statement you have got
return jsonResponse.business.map(business => .........
I think it should be
return jsonResponse.businesses.map(business => ......
However, as I say, my code is still saying I’ve made a bad request so I haven’t got it quite right either!
I’d be interested to hear if you have resolved your issue though. I didn’t want to post my question as it overlaps with yours.
Let me know!

Hi! I think the mistake might be done in app.js at the setState part in searchYelp. It should be
this.setState({businesses:businesses}) while you wrote
this.setState({business:businesses})

this.props is an object.  In that object there is expected to be a property called business.  The first example is extracting the value of the property business in this.props.  So it is the same as this.props.buisness.
The second example is looking for all the things that are on this.props.buisness but on this.props.

Hi! so baically, since we put business through curly braces in the definition of the const, it means that business is a property of props, am i right?
so, if we wrote
const business = this.props.business
it would be ok am i right? while writing
const {business} = this.props.business is wrong as {business} would then be equal to this.props.business.business
Is my thinking procedure ok?
"
93,Ravenous Part 4 - Categories key/value pair,"FAQ,React.js",advanced-react,2,"
Why are we supposed to match category  with category:business.categories[0].title instead of category:business.categories.title ? In Yelp documentation (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business),  categories is laid out as below. If I call the 1st item in the categories array by using categories[0], wouldn’t I always only get  {“alias”:“newamerican”,“title”:“American (New)”} which restricts my options and eliminate french, wine_bars etc.?
""categories"": [
    {
      ""alias"": ""newamerican"",
      ""title"": ""American (New)""
    },
    {
      ""alias"": ""french"",
      ""title"": ""French""
    },
    {
      ""alias"": ""wine_bars"",
      ""title"": ""Wine Bars""
    }
  ]

Well, you could choose another element other than the first, but does categories have a title property? What do you get if you try to console.log(business.categories.title)?
What if you you arbitrarily decided to use an index other than 0, and the returned array only had 1 element?
You could write code to randomly select an index based on the number of elements in the array if you wanted to, but if the categories are in an order of most applicable to least applicable (I have no idea if that’s the case), you could be using a less applicable value in your final result.

Hi @hypercoder457,
I think the error could be due to setting up a Constructor and mapTracks method in your TrackList component (I don’t think those two are needed). It looks like your code is correct for .map. You could try moving it to the render method so it returns .map between the div tags. See example below. Hope this helps!

Cheers!

I did that(I copied your example). But now I have another Error:

This is my code from TrackList.js:

Hey @hypercoder457 I might have found the issue. When you followed my example you received the error message because of TrackList /> in your playlist.js file. If you go into that file and comment out that line for the time being it should clear the error message.
You’ll eventually define tracks in TrackList /> in the playlist.js file. Hope this helps!

I removed the <TrackList /> component from Playlist.js But still same error is happening.

Sorry @hypercoder457 I thought I was going to be able to help! Were you able to figure out the solution?

Yes I was. Thanks @core2012045423

npm is a package manager, for installing packages. Not running them. Installing react globally also isn’t the recommend way to go.
I would recommend following the steps from the official documentation:
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
and use npx. Always check tutorials/blog against official release documentation, blogs and tutorials might become outdated.

Thanks!
However, I have searched for many solutions on the internet and have tried several solutions that were given. I initially did a global installation but have since uninstalled. I even went as far as to reinstall node.js.
Thereafter i followed the steps in the link you have provided:
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
However, i still got the same results. only a package.json and a package-lock.json
I also tried looking for ‘src’ in package.json, but it was not there.
There were also no scripts present.
Have been trying to solve this issue the past 2 days

This is what is printed on the terminal after ‘npx create-react-app my-app’

Why is that line repeated?
Still reading…

if you’re manually binding methods and then end up having an unbound this … that’s a bit suspicious no?
can’t do much without being able to reproduce the situation though, since finding the cause is something you’d do by working you way backwards from that situation to the cause - and this is not a complete executable program

Sorry, should have said, line 9 of BusinessList.js is:
this.props.businesses.map(function(business) {

I managed to fix it!
In app.js I had referred to
<BusinessList business={businesses} /> 

instead of
<BusinessList businesses={businesses} />.

Got there in the end!

Thanks for writing how you solved this. Same thing happened to me! 

rant mode on
Why on earth does Codecademy name everything the same thing? This causes so much unnecessary confusion and is a pain to follow.
“Set a callback function with an argument ‘business’. Call the business component and set the business property of the businessc ompoonent equal to the business parameter of the callback function”
errr… business.business = business - business squared?
Seriously!

Have you tried {this.business} instead of {business} as below?

101,React Developer Tools - Looks Different From Article,"FAQ,React.js",general,12,"
I am working through the React Developer Tools article, but when I open React Developer Tools in http://localhost:3000/ it looks different from what the article says I should be seeing. When I click on “Components” I see the following:

Then when I click on App and switch over to elements, I see $0 rather than $r and get an error when I try to use .setState() (see below):

Anyone have any idea why this could be happening?

I have the same problem

I have also the same problem. Was there an update?

upping this as I’m going through the same trouble. Anyone got any hint as to how to solve this and what’s wrong?

It’s been 11 days and no solution, not even a moderator.

I am having the same problem.

Maybe due to the new version of React DevTools released in late 2019…?



reactjs.org



Introducing the New React DevTools – React Blog
We are excited to announce a new release of the React Developer Tools, available today in Chrome, Firefox, and (Chromium) Edge! What’s changed?  A lot has changed in version 4!
At a high level, this new version should offer significant performance...






I am also having this problem.

Also having this problem. I even tried $r.setState({foo:“bar”}) and it returns the same error that OP describes.
My guess is that the new version of React DevTools has a different way of selecting and marking an element for access in the console.
Has anyone else found a way to do what the Ravenous setup instructions describe with $r ?
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-intro-to-react/modules/ravenous-part-one/informationals/ready-react-developer-tools

Same problem here too 3 months later. I wonder if we all submit bug reports they may update it. If anyone has any ideas about how this was solved, let us know!

There’s a decent little tutorial of the updates at https://react-devtools-tutorial.now.sh/
it has a fake browser and an explanation of the difference in the react devtools. Probably worth looking at, as the Codecademy one is now out of date. Good luck

103,What does ReactDOM.render() really do?,"FAQ,React.js",jsx,2,"
Hi all, I know this might sound like a dumb question, but the question below states that ReactDOM.render() appends the first argument to the second argument.
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/react-101-jsx-u/lessons/react-jsx-intro/exercises/reactdom-render-ii
However, in this other question, it contains this code snippet
const hello = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

// This will add ""Hello world"" to the screen:

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));

// This won't do anything at all:

ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));

Why won’t the second render do anything at all if it appends (as opposed to overwriting) to tag? I would have expected it to create 2 instances of Hello World on the screen. Does React see it as the same object?
Since I’m on this topic, how would I achieve creating 2 instances of Hello World on the screen? Do I manually put 2 <h1>Hello World</h1> wrapped in a div? Is there a better way?
Cheers all!
","
This FAQ contains some useful information:
Can I have multiple calls to ReactDOM.render() in a single JavaScript file?
Interacting with the DOM is expensive, so you should only render ones. Then react can use a virtual DOM to minimize and optimize interacting with the DOM.

104,Jammming Spotify Methods Async?,"FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
Hi community,
I just completed the Jammming project with React. A curious question, my VS code editor suggests to use Async & Await promises for the search() and savePlaylist() method. The guide video did not use or talk about it. Any particular reason for using or not using Async here for this project?

link : https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/jammming/projects/jammming-prj
After thinking I had finished the project I have realised that after clicking the “Save to Spotify” button the playlist name doesn’t change. The .savePlaylist() method in App.js should change it (this.state.playlistName)  back to its default value of ‘Playlist Name’. I have tried using the .setState() method and the .updatePlaylistName() method that was created for this project but neither will work. Everything else on the site and in the .setState() method work correctly, I just can’t seem to reset the playlist name. Please help me!
Here is the App.js code:
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SearchBar from '../SearchBar/SearchBar';
import SearchResults from '../SearchResults/SearchResults';
import Playlist from '../Playlist/Playlist';
import Spotify from '../../util/Spotify';

Spotify.getAccessToken();

class App extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      searchResults: [],
      playlistName: 'Playlist Name',
      playlistTracks: []
    };
    this.addTrack = this.addTrack.bind(this);
    this.removeTrack = this.removeTrack.bind(this);
    this.updatePlaylistName = this.updatePlaylistName.bind(this);
    this.savePlaylist = this.savePlaylist.bind(this);
    this.search = this.search.bind(this);
  }

  addTrack(track) {
    let tracks = this.state.playlistTracks;
    if (tracks.find(savedTrack => savedTrack.id === track.id)) {
      return;
    };

    tracks.push(track);
    this.setState({ playlistTracks: tracks})
  };

  removeTrack(track) {
    let tracks = this.state.playlistTracks;
    tracks = tracks.filter(currentTrack => currentTrack.id !== track.id);
    this.setState({ playlistTracks: tracks })
  };

  updatePlaylistName(name) {
    this.setState({ playlistName: name });

  savePlaylist() {
    const trackUris = this.state.playlistTracks.map(track => track.uri);
    Spotify.savePlaylist(this.state.playlistName, trackUris).then(() => {
      this.setState({
        playlistName: 'Playlist Name',
        playlistTracks: [] 
      })
    })
  }

  search(searchTerm) {
    Spotify.search(searchTerm).then(searchResults => {
      this.setState({ searchResults: searchResults })
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      < div >
        <h1>Ja<span className=""highlight"">mmm</span>ing</h1>
        <div className=""App"">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

And here is the Playlist.js code for the component:

I just used value instead of defaultValue.

Hi there,
I know this is a few months on from you posting your issue with the Jamming project, but I wondered if you ever managed to resolve the problem?  I have got the same issue regarding the playlist name not changing.
I tried the suggestion of using value instead of defaultValue but that didn’t work for me.
I would love to hear if you found a solution as it was such a long project and so frustrating to not be able to complete it 100%!

The value on the playlist name input element needs to be a variable that leads back to the this.state.playlistName.  make sure you set a “name” attribute on the input element that is also “playlistName”.  Also, you need to have an onChange function.  Then, in the file that holds your state (prop app.js), you can just make a function that
const updateStateInputField  = e => {
this.setState({
[e.target.name]: e.target.value
})
}
this way you can use the same function for both input elements dynamically.

Hello,
Thank you for your reply!
However havingf studied it closely I’m still not sure what I am missing -
I have got an onChange function and a function in app.js which updates this. I feel it must be something to do with the savePlaylist function as this is where it should be reset back to ‘New Playlist’ when the track list is set back to an empty array?
However I may be missing something from your explanation.
Here is my app.js and my playlist.js - if you have the time to look it over and see if I haven’t grasped what you have suggested then I would be very grateful for some more advice!
I have also noticed something strange, which may or may not be related to the other problem in my code is whenever the search button is first pressed it clears the search term but then accepts it the second time?! hmmm…
Here is my code
App.js
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

import Playlist from '../Playlist/Playlist';
import SearchBar from '../SearchBar/SearchBar';
import SearchResults from '../SearchResults/SearchResults';
import Spotify from '../../util/Spotify';

    this.updatePlaylistName = this.updatePlaylistName.bind(this);

    Spotify.search(term).then(searchResults => {

    let tracks = this.state.playlistTracks;
    if (tracks.find(savedTrack => savedTrack.id === track.id)) {
      return;
    }

    tracks.push(track);
    this.setState({playlistTracks: tracks});
  }

  removeTrack(track) {
    let tracks = this.state.playlistTracks;
    tracks = tracks.filter(currentTrack => currentTrack.id !== track.id);

  <button className=""Playlist-save""
          onClick = {this.props.onSave}>SAVE TO SPOTIFY</button>
</div>
    )
  }
}

export default Playlist;



A couple things -
First, I would refactor your playlist into a stateless functional component since it is a presentational component.  To do that, in Playlist.js,  just get rid of constructor method altogether, get rid of handleNameChange function altogether, and get rid of the render method BUT NOT THE RETURN STATEMENT INSIDE! then change the class Playlist component to an arrow function called Playlist that takes one parameter, props. Get rid of all references to this in the return statement.
Second, in app.js, change the name of updatePlaylist name function to updateInputText that takes an event.  Inside that function add the code i showed you above,
const updateInputText(e) {
this.setState({
[e.target.name]: e.target.value
})
}
bind it in the constructor, and then pass it as a prop to both the SearchBar component and the Playlistcomponent.
Last, in Playlist.js, in the input element, change defaultValue to value and set it to {props.playlistName}, put that “new playlist” text in a placeholder attribute, and set a name attribute to “playlistName”.

I had this problem, but I got it working correctly! Here’s my App.js and Playlist.js so it can be compared to the original post…

Did you use npx create-react-app?

I used npx create-react-app & another error comes up:

The system cannot find the path specified.

make sure you create the directory you want to store your your react app in
Either npx create-react-app my-directory
or
mkdir my-directory
cd my-directory
npx create-react-app . (include the dot so it knows to make the app in that directory)

My code is still throwing an error(the same error) I tried 3 times & it isn’t working.
Here is a screenshot:


if you are in first-app
npx create-react-app .
gotta have a space between app and “.”

I did that. Node.js is STILL throwing the SAME ERROR over & over again:
image1366×768 109 KB

Sorry for the messy post… the screenshot came out messy. hope you can see the error.

I can see it.
This might be a windows thing, which I can’t help you with.  Just copy the error text into google and see what comes up, might be some type of -sudo command you have to run.
Good luck!

The problem here looks to be being caused by the Windows user account you have created.
I have never seen an account with spaces in it and it is creating a home folder with those same spaces.
The problem is compounded by the fact you are using a Linux shell (Git Bash) and it is unable to resolve those spaces.
The error shows that it is being cut off at the first space in the user account name.
C:\Users\Rudra
Usually within a Windows cmdline shell, if you have a filepath that has spaces you need to wrap everything in double quotes. ie “c:\folder with  spaces”, especially if its part of a command line application.
Easiest thing would be to create another Windows account with out spaces in and login with that and then you can use the desktop to save stuff.
Or you would have to create your project in a folder with an absolute path, ie c:\projects.
Or you could attempt you used the Windows Command Line and not use Git Bash.

In this file I added a new variable: firstTerm to the main scope.

      // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
      sessionStorage.term = firstTerm;
} else {
     // Sorry! No Web Storage support..

In this file I modified only the search() method:

As you see this is not a react code at all.
When the app redirected I need to check the session storage (or the cookie) for the search query. I need to send this data to the SearchBar.js.
Is anyone can help me translate this logic to the react?

BusinessList is getting passed an undefined businesses prop - so it’s throwing an error when it tries to map an undefined object.
BussinessList is getting called by App which passes in this.state.businesses - try console logging this.state.businesses in the App and see what you have at that point. If that is undefined you can continue working backwards. For instance, after you call Yelp.searchYelp in App.js, try console logging businesses and see if that is undefined. If so, you likely have a problem in your Yelp file.

this.state.businesses


Hi there,
I’m struggling with this part of the project too and wonder if you could help me. I am about to give up but would really like to have learnt something from this whole process. When you advise to console.log this.state.businesses - which seems like  a great idea to find out how the thing is working -where exactly do I put the console log statement into the code? Each time I try to put it in it throws up another error . Do I have to comment out some of my other code in order for this to work? I understand debugging is all part of learning - so it would be great if I could manage to do this ! I know its a few months on from when you were originally doing this but any help would be really appreciated…

Console log is javascript, so it has to be written where you are writing other javascript. Write it where you first get info from yelp to make sure you are getting something back. If you’re getting what you expect, keep following the chain and make sure that in each class it’s still there. If the console log is throwing its own error that will need to be addressed first. Make sure you are writing that correctly inside other javascript.

hey guys, i had this same problem. it seems to be really simple, i looked in the forums and a return is missing somewhere.

Hi thanks for your reply,
Unfortunately I must have other problems within my code as this wasn’t the simple solution for me.
Any help welcome !

In your Yelp.js you are logging “businesses” but you defined it as “business”. So of course your log will be undefined. You really need to watch on this project singular vs plural and capitalized vs lowercase.

After you can log something successful from your yelp call, keep logging it at every step to make sure it’s defined through all your pages and functions. If changing your log to “business” still doesn’t log anything you’ll need to fix your yelp call.

Hi,
Thanks for your response and your patience!
I changed my log to business and it still doesn’t log anything.
When you suggest fixing the yelp call - do you think the issue is with my Yelp.js or possibly with one of the other files?
I’ve sifted through all the other suggestions which other people seem to have made to correct this but I can’t seem to fix it.
Any other suggestions?

Your Yelp.js file is where the information from yelp is coming in, so if you are missing Yelp data that’s where you should start. It has been a couple years since I did that project, so it’s hard for me to spot errors right away, but keep backing your console.log up to make sure you’re getting what you expect at each step. Like, in your first .then(), put one in there to see if you are getting something back from your fetch. I’m assuming you have a valid apiKey in your real file, right? Not just an empty string? Start with that first fetch and see what you get back.

When I did the project I needed an access token (in place of your apiKey) which I got with my client Id and secret key each time I fetched the businesses from yelp, but like I said it has been a couple years so things easily could have changed.

It’s unreachable code because you put it after the return - put it right before the return and you’re in the right spot. =) Let me know what it logs at that point, that will tell us a lot.
One year after I did this project I built a fairly involved React site for a local teen center to register students and sign them in and out every day and the admin side runs all the reports they need for their grants. They used to do it all on paper and their reports took months to put together, now they are instant. They’ve been using the app every day for over a year and they love it.
And shortly after I finished that I got hired as a full stack application developer! I’ve been working there a little over a year and I love it so much. I build so many cool things every day, I love my team, I love my company. I’m a self-taught developer but I’ve been doing it a long time in a lot of different languages. About 15 years now.

Just log the response, not the response.json(). Show me what that says.
We want to see what comes right out of your fetch without doing a bunch of things to it.

And you don’t need to turn your API key into an access token anymore? Is there a link to this project? It would help if I could see the directions.
And I think any time you get stuck and figure it out you learn more. If you get it right the first time you are doing things that are way too easy and you aren’t pushing yourself as a programmer! I was handed about 8 giant apps to maintain and build on and most of them are old and I think my experience as a self-taught programmer really helped. Being able to hunt down problems and figure out how to solve them on my own came in handy right away. Don’t get discouraged, this is perfect job training!

Here is the link to the project:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/ravenous-part-four/projects/interacting-with-yelp-api
And here is what I get I try to log the response:

I plugged your code into Postman to check the API request and I got an authorization error, so I replaced your api key with mine and I got results. Check here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app to make sure you have your api key correct. The error in postman says specifically that the Bearer doesn’t match.

Fantastic - I’m getting somewhere… So I changed the apikey - don’t know why I’d got it wrong? - Now amazingly I have some results!!! Which I’d never thought I’d see. But … my results don’t show any pictures (just black squares) (not that I’m complaining at this stage ).
I’m interested to learn how to interpret what the console.log(response) is giving me - which is:
Response {type: “cors”, url: “https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.ye…ch?term=pizza&location=chicago&sort_by=best_match”, redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, …}
?

Yay! console.log(response) is giving you the response of your fetch request. The main thing to look at is the status code. Now it’s status: 200 (OK) which means it worked. Before it was status: 400 (Bad Request) which tells you that you probably didn’t make a valid request or some of your data was bad (like your api key). When you aren’t getting back what you think you should get it’s a very good idea to go all the way back to your request and check your status code and see what the original data looks like. This has more info on status codes: https://httpstatuses.com

I also know why you aren’t getting your images to show up. It’s a small error, but one that I saw a lot when I was helping people with this project. And it’s not a coding error! You need to make sure you spell everything correctly…

111,Jammming Project - Error When Saving Playlist,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",17,"
I am close to finishing the Jammming project and most everything seems to be working as expected. However, when I save a playlist, it doesn’t save to my Spotify account. When I look in the console, I see the below:

Here is my Spotify.js code:
const clientId = '[Redacted]';
const redirectUri = 'http://localhost:3000/';

let accessToken;

const Spotify = {
  getAccessToken() {
    if (accessToken) {
      return accessToken;
    }

    // check for access token match
    const accessTokenMatch = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/);
    const expiresInMatch = window.location.href.match(/expires_in=([^&]*)/);

    if (accessTokenMatch && expiresInMatch) {
      accessToken = accessTokenMatch[1];
      const expiresIn = Number(expiresInMatch[1]);
      //This clears the parameters, allowing us to grab a new access token when it expires
      window.setTimeout(() => accessToken = '', expiresIn * 1000);
      window.history.pushState('Access Token', null, '/');
      return accessToken;
    } else {
      const accessUrl = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}`;
      window.location = accessUrl;
    }
  },

  search(term) {
    const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
    return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track&q=${term}`, {
      headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`}
    }).then(response => {
      return response.json();
    }).then(jsonResponse => {
      if (!jsonResponse.tracks) {
        return [];
      }
      return jsonResponse.tracks.items.map(track => ({
        id: track.id,
        name: track.name,
        artist: track.artists[0].name,
        album: track.album.name,
        uri: track.uri
      }));
    });
  },

  savePlaylist(name, trackUris) {
    if (!name || !trackUris.length) {
      return;
    }

    const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
    const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`};
    let userId;

    return fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me', {headers: headers}
    ).then(response => response.json()
    ).then(jsonResponse => {
      userId = jsonResponse.id;
      return fetch(`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/http://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${userId}/playlists`,
        {
          headers: headers,
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({name: name})
      }).then(response => response.json()
      ).then(jsonResponse => {
        const playlistId = jsonResponse.id;
        return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/${playlistId}/tracks`, {
          headers: headers,
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify({uris: trackUris})
      })
    })
  });
  }
}

export default Spotify;


Note that I included https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ in the second fetch() request because I was getting a CORS error in addition to the 404 error. Don’t think that is what the issue is. Also note that I saw here that the project uses outdated POST formatting so I tried the abbreviated address mentioned in that post, but it didn’t help.
It seems like the issue is that the playlist ID is not being saved to the playlistId variable because in the error it has “undefined” where the ID should be, but I’m not sure why that is happening or how to fix it. Anyone else experienced this/know why it is happening?
","
What do you see if you console log playlistId just after this line?
const playlistId = jsonResponse.id;

Undefined. It seems like maybe there is some issue with the jsonResponse not containing a playlist id, but I’m not sure why that would be happening. I tried going through the walkthrough video and copying the code step by step but it didn’t seem to help.

return fetch(‘https://api.spotify.com/v1/me’, {headers: headers} ).then(response => response.json() ).then(jsonResponse => {


console log the values above as well: response, response.json(), and jsonResponse
See what comes back.  You should be able to look through the jsonResponse and see the properties

Thanks for the responses. When I logged response.json(), I got an error that said “body stream is locked”. According to this, that happens when you use response.json() more than once. However, the solutions suggested in that article didn’t fix the problem. I got the below when I logged jsonResponse (sorry for the black bars, trying to avoid posting my name on the forum):

Is the jsonResponse.tracks working for you in the ‘search’ function just above this savePlayList function?
From the object you posted, is there another property showing a User ID?  I see the IDs connected to each song but I can’t see past those. I’m curious to know if that property name has changed from ‘id’ to ‘userID’ for example and that’s what is throwing the code off.

jsonResponse.tracks seems to be working from what I can tell. When I log it to the console it seems fine. When I look through the jsonResponse object I posted, the only ID property I see is for each individual song like you noted.

Hi
Upping this thread since I seem to be running through the exact same issue, and my playlistID also comes back as undefined…
As extra info about the behavior I can add that:
1/I’ve tried to substitute my Spotify.savePlaylist method with the one provided in the solution code, but still got the same issue.
2/I’ve tried to substitute my whole Spotify.js with the one provided in the solution code but had an issue saying I’m missing client_id on clicking on search (Error I didn’t have in my code…).
3/When I use my code, I can look for song, add them to the right column with the “+” button, change the name of the playlist, but as soon as I hit the Save Playlist button, it wipes the tracks in the playlist column, and:
a/Doesn’t reset the playlist name as expected
b/Doesn’t create or save anything to my Spotify account
which is very puzzling, since it seems the function is called but somehow doesn’t execute as expected…
Here is my code for app.js and Spotify.js
app.js :
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SearchBar from '../SearchBar/SearchBar';
import SearchResults from '../SearchResults/SearchResults';
import Playlist from '../Playlist/Playlist';
import Spotify from '../../util/Spotify';

class App extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      searchResults:[],
      playlistName: 'New Playlist',
      playlistTracks: []
    };
    this.addTrack = this.addTrack.bind(this);
    this.removeTrack = this.removeTrack.bind(this);
    this.updatePlaylistName = this.updatePlaylistName.bind(this);
    this.savePlaylist = this.savePlaylist.bind(this);
    this.search = this.search.bind(this);
  }
  search(term){
    Spotify.search(term).then(searchResult=>this.setState({searchResults: searchResult})
  )};

  savePlaylist(){
  let trackURIs=this.state.playlistTracks.map(x=>x.uri);
Spotify.savePlaylist(this.state.playlistName,trackURIs).then(()=>
{this.setState({
  playlistName: 'New Playlist',
  playlistTracks: []}
  )}
  );
  };

  addTrack(track){
    if(this.state.playlistTracks.find(savedTrack => savedTrack.id === track.id)){
        return;
      }else{this.state.playlistTracks.push(track);
        this.setState({playlistTracks: this.state.playlistTracks})};
      };
  
  removeTrack(track){
    let i=0;
    for(i=0;i<this.state.playlistTracks.length;i++){    
    if(this.state.playlistTracks[i].id !== track.id){
      return
    }else{
      let newPlaylist = this.state.playlistTracks.filter(bob => bob.id !== track.id);
      this.setState({playlistTracks: newPlaylist});
          }
        }
      };

  updatePlaylistName(name){
    this.setState({playlistName: name})
              };

  render(){
    return(<div>

        window.setTimeout(() => accessToken = '', expiresIn * 1000);
        window.history.pushState('Access Token', null, '/');
return accessToken;
    }else{
    window.location = finalQ;
    };
};

},

search(term){
   let acctok = this.getAccessToken();
   return fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track&q='+term, {headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${acctok}`}}).then(

        uri: track.uri
        }
        )
        );
    });
},

savePlaylist(playName,trackUri){
const accessToken= Spotify.getAccessToken();
if (!playName || !trackUri.length) {

  }
    let header = {Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`};
    let userID = '';

    });
})})
    
}
};



export default Spotify;

Would really appreciate any help.

What do the errors in the console say?
I keep thinking to wrap this function in a try/catch block so you can see what the error is. It may be an authentication error but would be good to confirm that.

I got a 404 error, which I guess makes sense given that it seems like the problem is that the playlist id is undefined in the jsonResponse object.

I did this course a couple of years ago. I got it working and the playlists would save in my Spotify account.  here’s my code so you can see if it helps.  Also clientId should be initialized to an empty string rather than placeholder.
const Spotify = {

  // Retrieves an access token from Spotify API to authenticate requests and retrieve data
  getAccessToken: function() {
    if (userAccessToken) {
      return userAccessToken;
    }

      const accessTokenValue = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/);
      const expireTimeValue = window.location.href.match(/expires_in=([^&]*)/);

        if (accessTokenValue && expireTimeValue) {
          userAccessToken = accessTokenValue[1];
          const expiresIn = Number(expireTimeValue[1]);
          window.setTimeout(() => userAccessToken = '', expiresIn * 1000);
          window.history.pushState('Access Token', null, '/');
        } else {
          window.location = `${url}?client_id=${clientId}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectURI}`;
        }
  },

  search: function(term) {
    const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();
      return fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track&q=${term}`, {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
        }
      }).then(response => {
        return response.json();
      }).then(jsonResponse => {
        if (!jsonResponse.tracks) {
        return [];
      }
      console.log(jsonResponse.tracks);
      return jsonResponse.tracks.items.map(track => ({

        name: track.name,
        artist: track.artists[0].name,

        preview: track.preview_url,
        uri: track.uri
      }));
     });
   },

   savePlaylist: function(listName, trackUris) {
     if ( !listName || !trackUris.length ) {
        return;
       }

       const accessToken = Spotify.getAccessToken();

Thanks for taking the time to help!
Just to clarify, the “placeholder” in my code is well replaced with my client ID. Same as the code I pasted below, the clientID in the URL stands for my actual client ID, just didnt want to paste it here.
I’ll see what I can do with your code.
Meanwhile, here are the 2 errors I’m getting:

Interesting update:
I’ve replaced my Spotify Object with yours, and it worked!!!..Partially 
The playlist is saved into my spotify account and the tracks are there, BUT, the playlist name is not reset to ‘New Playlist’ (Also the tracks still get wiped from the playlist column).
I’ll look further into our code differences and try to spot what caused this.
EDIT:
After looking further and doing a few edits, it seems the main cause of the error were the following for me:
1/My accessUrl was wrong:
``{queryUrl}?client_id={clientID}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&response_type=token;
instead of
``{url}?client_id={clientId}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectURI};
But that is weird, cause even with that, I managed to get results from the search function before I update to the right URL… I guess this worked somehow for GET request but not POST??
However now I get an even weirder behavior:
If I look for artists, songs etc…I have searched in the past using this app, proper search results come out, and then I’m also able to look for never-searched-before artists/songs. BUT! If I refresh the page and try to look for a new song/artist with a keyword I’ve never used before, I get a “Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property ‘items’ of undefined” caused by my search function, and when logging the result of the fetch() in the search function, I get:

[[PromiseStatus]]: “resolved”
[[PromiseValue]]: Object
error:
1. status: 401
2. message: “Invalid access token”

So it seems there’s a problem with how the access token is being handled, and maybe not reset/created properly in some patterns? I find it weird that I can look for past looked for artist, and that when I do so, it kinda open the door for me to look for never-looked-before artists without creating an error.
Here’s my edited Spotify Object for reference:
const clientID = placeholder;
const queryUrl = 'https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize';

That is really strange!  I went back and looked at my code in App.js to if it may have to do with setting State but it’s really straight-forward.
What does this line look like in the console?  How long do they give you before it expires?
const expiresIn = Number(expin[1]);


Thanks for the reply!
It gives me 3600, as expected I guess.
EDIT: it’s getting weirder and weirder.
I’ve tried to paste back my original code (so that I could try to re-edit it again step by step and try to isolate the part that doesn’t work properly), but by doing so, my past code who would not let me save a playlist, now does,BUT! The playlist in my spotify is empty (even though the name is correct).
It really feels like the access token is having some weird behavior…It feels like once it worked once, it must have saved something somewhere, allowing to save playlist now… My search function now works differently as well. I’m not getting the spotify login page anymore, but instead I get the access token instantly through the updated url. And when I try to hit search with a blank field after obtaining the token, I get those 2 errors:

This worked for me as well. I’m not 100% sure why, but it does seem like it may have something to do with the access URL. I didn’t originally include a response type or a scope, so maybe that was the source of my problem. Really appreciate all the help!

Hi there,
Did you manage to solve the issues you were having with the Jammming project?
I seem to be nearly there - I have got it to the stage that playlists are saving - but when saved the playlist name doesn’t change back to New Playlist. I think that was one of the issues you were having - did you  get that bit working properly?
I had to have a break from it for a week or so as I had been boggling at it for too long!!
"
112,Jammming Project map function undefined?,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,7,"
Hi All,
Having an annoying issue with the map function for creating an array of components.
My code
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';

import {Track} from '../Track/Track';

export class TrackList extends React.Component {

  listTracks() {
    console.log(this.props.listedTracks);
    return this.props.listedTracks.map(track => {
      return <Track key={track.id} title={track.title} artist={track.artist} album={track.album} />
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""TrackList"">
        {this.listTracks()}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

keep getting the same error but the data looks fine when i console log the array?
Error message;
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
TrackList.listTracks
C:/Users/Steve-Laptop/OneDrive/Documents/WebSite/React/Jammming/jammming/src/components/TrackList/TrackList.js:10

   8 |  listTracks() {

  12 |    });
  13 |  }

log output is the expected array though?
(2) [{…}, {…}]
0: {id: ""1"", name: ""Getting Jiggy With it"", artist: ""Will Smith"", album: ""Be Jiggy""}
1: {id: ""2"", name: ""Lady In Red"", artist: ""Chris De Burgh"", album: ""Greatest Hits""}
length: 2
__proto__: Array(0)

","
Okay i posted this then realized that someone literally just posted the same problem.
I have spotted something interesting in my console log below;
[HMR] Waiting for update signal from WDS...
TrackList.js:11 {tracks: Array(2)}tracks: Array(2)0: {id: ""1"", name: ""Getting Jiggy With it"", artist: ""Will Smith"", album: ""Be Jiggy""}1: {id: ""2"", name: ""Lady In Red"", artist: ""Chris De Burgh"", album: ""Greatest Hits""}length: 2__proto__: Array(0)__proto__: Object
TrackList.js:11 undefined

it seems as if react is creating the component twice but the first line is shows my expected array and the second line it seems that it is now undefined which would explain my error.
Is this a react bug?
this is my edited code for the log
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';

import {Track} from '../Track/Track';

export class TrackList extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    console.log(this.props.searchResults);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""TrackList"">
        <Track />
      </div>
    );
  }
}


Hi There,
Have you managed to solve this issue?
Also stuck using the ‘map’ property on the array, whereas my array does show up in the react component’s logs.
Cheers

Hi,
Its simpler than you think, look at this code
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

import {SearchBar} from '../SearchBar/SearchBar';
import {SearchResults} from '../SearchResults/SearchResults';
import {Playlist} from '../Playlist/Playlist';

export class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    //initial tracks array
    this.state = {
      searchResults:[
      {
        id:'1', 
        name:'Getting Jiggy With it', 
        artist:'Will Smith', 
        album:'Be Jiggy'
      },
      {
        id:'2', 
        name:'Lady In Red', 
        artist:'Chris De Burgh', 
        album:'Greatest Hits'
      }
    ],
    playlist:[
      {
        id:'1', 
        name:'Getting Jiggy With it', 
        artist:'Will Smith', 
        album:'Be Jiggy'
      },
      {
        id:'2', 
        name:'Lady In Red', 
        artist:'Chris De Burgh', 
        album:'Greatest Hits'
      }
    ]};
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Ja<span className=""highlight"">mmm</span>ing</h1>
        <div className=""App"">
          <SearchBar />
          <div className=""App-playlist"">
            <SearchResults searchResults={this.state.searchResults} />
            <Playlist playlist={this.state.playlist}/>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>    
    );
  }
}


Playlist was the issue as I hadn’t defined any properties for it and it also uses the Tracklist component, if you pass it some properties also then you may find the issue goes away.
Hope that helps!

                }
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default TrackList;


Why log out the dataset double times?
If I delete the comment from the Playlist.js line 10: <TrackList /> then log to the console 4 times. And the third and fourth are undefined. My code crash because I try to map an undefined value instead of array.
Any idea?

Both the SearchResults Component and Playlist Component use the Tracklist component, you have passed the array as a prop called searchResults which is good for that component but you haven’t passed anything to the Playlist component!
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Ja<span className=""highlight"">mmm</span>ing</h1>
        <div className=""App"">
          <SearchBar />
          <div className=""App-playlist"">
            <SearchResults searchResults={this.state.searchResults} />
            <Playlist playlist={this.state.searchResults}/> <--- You need to add a prop to this!!!!!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>    
    );
  }


I would say it is more that you need to pass a different prop to the playlist component rather than add a new one.  I would recommend passing the prop of “tracks” to both the playlist and searchResults components and having them set to their respective arrays in the state object.  That way the Tracklist component can just map through this.props.tracks for both the SearchResults and Playlist components.

Hi James.
First try to console.log the response.json() to see if the response is sending the correct data from the fetch you made. If you see the data on your console log then you can manipulate that data otherwise you need to check if you are fetching the data correctly.
Hope this helps.

Hello,
@jameswaterman I was wondering the same thing as you. I found https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business on the Yelp Developer site. This lists the keys required in step 19 and info on them. I THINK this is the answer you were looking for.
As state I was wondering the same thing as you and this is what I was able to find.
Cheers!

if you are using the fetch api, don’t forget to handle the promise, i.e. Yelp.search(business).then(response);

Hey guys I think I have a simple questions, and was hoping for some clarification on this exercise on ‘stateless components and stateful components’.
Please see the code below:
import React from ‘react’;
import ReactDOM from ‘react-dom’;
import { Child } from ‘./Child’;
class Parent extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
**    super(props);**
this.state = { name: ‘Frarthur’ };
}
render() {
return ;
}
};
Am I correct to assume the “constructor(props)” is taking information of other props from the ‘react’ file?, and that the “super(props)” is passing information such as the “this.state = { name: 'Frarthur }” back tot he react file making it access-able to the Child.js file?
Because in the Child.js… :
import React from ‘react’;
export class Child extends React.Component {
render() {
return Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!
}
};
…I see a “{this.props.name}”. Is “props” here a place holder, or is it exchanging information with the Parent.js even though it’s not imported?
Just wanted clarification. Thank you in advance!
","
Hey -
You might want to go to the react documentation to see exactly how the lifecycles work under the hood.
I’m not sure if you are thinking about the ‘react’ file the right way - that is just the import of the react library.
You don’t even have to have a constructor with super(props) every time - I really only do that if that’s going to be a component that will have props passed into it.  As the documentation says:
"" When implementing the constructor for a  React.Component  subclass, you should call  super(props)  before any other statement. Otherwise,  this.props  will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs.""
It’s not really “passing info back to the react file”, it’s just making sure you can refer to the component level info with the this keyword.  the state object is also contained to the parent component.  If you want the child to have access to that info, then pass if to the child as a prop.

Make sure you’re using the same name for the attribute you’re passing in to BusinessList and the prop inside of BusinessList

I’ve cross checked it several times…

<BusinessList  business ={businesses} />
this.props. businesses .map
They are different.

117,React map() - like we do with handlebars,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",1,"
Hi I can’t do with this like we use to do with handlebars - to do something {{for each}} how can we achieve that with react, I am trying to do post list for blog to make it simple I did something like this:
let a = {

let arrayOfJsx = a.map( item =>  I am { this.news.name}  I am { this.news.age} years old. )

118,Authorization Form,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
Hi Everyone,
In the Authorization Form exercise (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/projects/authorization-form), you are required to change the h1 tag text depending on whether a user is authorized or not. The hint shows that this can be achieved by placing a ternary operator within the h1 tag. In earlier lessons, we are told not to inject if statements into JSX expressions. So why does this work?
Many thanks

Greetings.
Are you importing ‘./App’ in index.js?  ex. import App from './App';
Is the App.js in the src folder?
Is App.js being properly exported in App.js? ex. export default App;

Instead of using the render method inside the App function use a return statement:
function App() {
    return(
        <div className=""App"">
            <h1>ravenous</h1>

First guess I would say It looks like it´s not able to access the path to cmd correctly. Maybe adding cmd  to the global variables path would solve this…

and how exactly am I supposed to do that? I am newbie so please help me out.

So I´v found this stack overflow issue that seems to have the same error pattern. I suggest you read the solutions.

The parser has no idea what’s wrong.
It can’t tell you that line 9 is the problem.
But it can tell you that from what it has read so far, line 9 doesn’t make sense.
So when would something be unexpected? When something else is expected. When would something be expected? If you started something that needs finishing. It’s up to you to close your parentheses and so on.

Thanks for your response but there is actually a closing div tag in my code at Line 13 which doesn’t show in error message above so it shouldn’t be the issue. The closing parenthese for the return statement and a curly one for the App component are there too; they just don’t show in error message that I copied and pasted from terminal.

Didn’t say it was a div tag.
Closing whatever it is at line 13 wouldn’t help, since things already don’t make sense by line 9. You’d need to look upwards. Not downwards.
a.js:
)


$ node a.js

SyntaxError: Unexpected token )

For this file, you would need an opening brace, otherwise the parser encounters a closing brace even though one wasn’t opened, making it unexpected. There’s nothing too exotic about this kind of error. Make sure everything matches up, that is all.
If you have more code in that general area than you can handle, then try commenting some out and then add it back in only in matching increments.

Sorry, I’m not sure if I understand your point. You say things already don’t make sense by line 9. Can you please clarify what things? I already checked a few times and everything matches up in the code; it is exactly the same as provided in the project walkthrough video.

Hi Did you find the solution?
I am having similar issues… I have read that it could be something to do with how babelrc is installed(?) by React but the technicality of it goes beyond my current comprehension…

Unfortunately no, I even contacted one of the moderators but couldn’t find a solution so gave up and moved on. Please let me know if you find out anything.

Hi,
So I totally deleted the project and started again with fresh eyes.
I believe I have found the issue at Step 47. Can you check your App.js file and copy it here. If the file is using -
function App() {....}

Which is the way create-react-app seems to have installed it for me, then you may need to change the syntax to -
class App extends React.Component {.....};

Hope this helps!

Hi, I got fed up and moved on with the project so cannot really tell now what the problem was (think I will need to do what you did and start again with fresh eyes) but thanks for your message, others who face the same issue can find this post and refer to your suggestion here. Cheers!

Hey, I’m experiencing the same issue. I even changed the App.js file to class App React.Component {}.      And no luck. Still Failure to Compile error. Did you find a solution?>

Hey, can  you further explain how you found the solution? I am currently going through the same problem but class App extends React.Component {…}; is giving me errors as well.

123,Authorization Form Question,"FAQ,React.js",general,2,"
Hey all - just want to make sure I understand what’s going on here. Code below:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Contact extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      password: 'swordfish',
      authorized: false
    };
    this.authorize = this.authorize.bind(this);
  }

  authorize(e) {
    const password = e.target.querySelector(
      'input[type=""password""]').value;
    const auth = password == this.state.password;
    this.setState({
      authorized: auth
    });
  }

The use of this in this.state and this.authorize while within the constructor() function but after super means that props has a state and authorize property that we can’t see, but we know is being inherited from props. Is this right?
What is confusing me is referencing this.authorize before we define the authorize() method right below it.
I’m also confused about the syntax and meaning of the .bind property, but perhaps this is yet another method hidden in the props class we inherited through constructor.
Am I on the right track? Any clarity is greatly appreciated!
NOTE: This code was all pre-written by the platform. I can’t go and see what’s being inherited through super.

The object assigned to this.state in App.js appears to get passed in to the components SearchResults and Playlists correctly when I check in devtools in chrome. The weird thing is, the error message only appears when, in Playlist.js, I use an instance of the Tracklist component. When I use the Tracklist component in SearchResults.js the webpage loads with no issues.
Presumably ‘cannot read property map of undefined’ means that it doesn’t recognise the props I’m passing down to map, however I checked in the console before and the object appears correctly. I have tried to follow the video walk through but don’t see any error in my code.
Thanks

sure but do you invoke them the same way?
if you use an empty array does one crash while the other doesn’t?
<TrackList tracks={[]}/>
the location of where you do it isn’t the difference
if you look at the error message, you can tell that undefined was provided as input, so that tells you what the difference is, you provided incorrect input. you could for example provide an empty array to show that this is the case, the error will go away, and after that, you can consider where you’ve put the value you meant to pass along
if you can see the value you want in your debug console, great, use that value.

Thanks for the help! I used an empty array as you said and for the first time when using the  component in Playlist it didn’t crash. Then when I passed in the relevant props again to each TrackList component it worked perfectly.

You can go two ways:

give yourself the permissions you need to install the package globally
installing the package locally per project


perfect thankyou! How would I achieve either of those?

Given the -g flag is responsible for Global installation, installing locally should be relative easy to figure out? Also consult the official documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
articles, blogs and tutorials can get behind/outdated.
If you don’t know how to give yourself additional privileges, you need to read up on that. Here is a start:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/181893/what-are-the-root-permissions-for-a-file

Per the documentation at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app, you do not want to install it globally:

If you’ve previously installed  create-react-app  globally via  npm install -g create-react-app , we recommend you uninstall the package using  npm uninstall -g create-react-app  to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

Instead, npx is recommended (which comes with npm):
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

When I went one step back and inspected the page I found that the props is existing.
Please advise for what could be the proplem !!!
","
I have the same problems. I figure this could happen due to a way computer tries to undestand text writing in Visual Studio Code.
The way I fixed it (at least worked for me), is to go back to App.js, in the SearchResults Component, copy and paste every single instant of searchResults, and copy and paste it to SearchResults.js. This, at least to ensure that, even though the text looks the same, they are not the same.
This happens to me a couple times as I was coding Ruby on Rails, and I realized that when I copy and paste text into an app, it might be different from the one that I wrote directly.

Thanks a lot.
I tried it and problem solved.

Hello,
can you please be more specific?

Hi, it means that when you have a variable, Class or Object that is exported from one .js to another .js, you should:

Rewrite this variable
Copy and paste this variable from one file to another

I was explained that this is due to how computer encodes text. So if you copy a piece of code from a someone’s else computer, and paste it into your VSC, it might have different encoding.

I’ve spent several hours on google, and it seems I’m declaring everything as it should be, yet when I console.log this.props.location in my Dealers component, it returns:
{pathname: ""/Dealers"", search: """", hash: """", state: undefined}
hash: """"
pathname: ""/Dealers""
search: """"
state: undefined

So this means the states have not been recorded properly in the previous step 
The console.log in my NavMenu for this.props.dealers returns the expected value, so this means when I declare:
<Link to={{
        pathname:'/Dealers',
        state:{
        dealers: this.props.dealers,
        show:this.props.show,
        getId:this.props.getId,
        searchResults:this.props.searchResults,
        search:this.props.search,
    }}}>
    {console.log(this.props.dealers)}
    <button className=""dealr button"" onClick={<Dealers/>}>Dealers</button>
    </Link>

each value of the state should be assigned a proper value. But somehow, it seems like it’s not working as expected…
Could someone give me a hand with this? ^^;
What am I doing wrong here?

131,Fetch() and setState() update timing trouble,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,6,"
Hello!
I’m working on a solo project using React and I’ve been stuck on something for the past 2 days… 
To try to be concise and clear:
It’s a bit like the Ravenous project. I have a searchBar component, that search through a local database, and returned object associated with the search keyword. Nothing complicated so far.
Each rendered object has a button that triggers a function onClick. The said function is a follow:
changeState(term){
    let idToRender=[];
    this.state.dealersDb.map(dealer=>{
    if(term===dealer.id){
        idToRender=[dealer];
        }});
    let recoToFind=idToRender[0].reco;
    recoToFind.map(item=>{
        Discogs.search(item).then(response=>{idToRender[0].recoInfo.push(response)})
    })
    
    this.setState({
    objectToRender: idToRender
    });

to explain the above code, what it does is that first, it identifies which object’s button has been clicked on, and send said object to a variable called idToRender. Then, it takes the reco state of that object, and store it to another variable called recoToFind. Then it calls the map() method on recoToFind, make an API request (the discogs() method) for each element of the recoToFind array and push() the results into the recoInfo state of idToRender. So by the end of the function, idToRender is supposed to look like this:
[{
…
…
recoInfo: [{1stAPI call result},{2ndAPI call result}…]
}],
The array contains 1 object having all the states of the object that was originally clicked on, plus a state recoInfo equal to an array made of the results of the several API calls.
Finally, it updates the component’s state objectToRender to idToRender.
And here my problem is, onClick, I do get all the states values of the clicked on object that get rendered on screen (as expected with how I coded the nested components), BUT, the values of the recoInfo are not displayed as expected (The component who’s supposed to render those values is nested in the component rendering the clicked on object other states values). However, they get displayed properly after a SECOND click on the button. So it seems my problem boils down to an update timing trouble, but I’m puzzled, cause this function is calling setState once and I know for a fact that the state is updated cause when I click on the button, the clicked on Object details get displayed, but somehow the recoInfo state seems to not be available yet, but only becomes available on a second click…
Would anyone have a way to solve this issue? 
It somehow feels like my salvation lies in async/await, but I’m not sure I understand them correctly…
thanks very much in advance for any help!
","
I can’t verify this because you’re not giving me something I can reproduce and I don’t really know what’s going on - but updating state is something you’d do as part of handling the response, which won’t happen until after you’ve exited the current function (you have to yield before other events can run)
Since you have many requests, you have to wait for all of them. You have a list of requests and you want to turn that into something that looks like a request for a list - you could write a function that does this, or maybe there’s some library function from that in the same library that (because that’s a pretty generic thing, but I have no clue what’s in that ecosystem), but making the function is probably interesting and not that difficult as long as you keep in mind what’s going on.
I suppose simpler yet would be to update once on each response, not sure I like the idea but I won’t deny that it would at least be correct. (With the downside of causing many re-renderings)

Thank you ionatan!
So I’ve tried calling the setState on each response, and indeed, it worked, but causes many re-rendering thus adding a little delay on the rendering of the final result. But, although it does work, I don’t understand why the state is updated correctly when I call the setState on each response, but is not updated correctly when I call setState in the same function, but only once, with the object composed of the results from the various api calls. Both setState are called within my changeState() method, one way work as expected but the other doesn’t… Could you try to give me some keys for a better understanding of this process? It really feels like I’m missing something here…
btw, here’s the whole code for the component where changeState() is declared, as well as the Discogs() method:

as you can see, I have declared a getRecoDetails() method that I’m not using anymore, but it’s a trace of my past attempt to isolate the function for the API calls, but I would always end up in either infinite loops, or results displayed x times where x is the number of re-rendering basically…
Here’s the discogs method:
const apiKey='hidden for privacy';
const secret='hidden for privacy';

let Discogs = {
search(id){
return fetch(`https://api.discogs.com/releases/${id}?key=${apiKey}&secret=${secret}`,{
    header:{
        'User-Agent':'MyRecordDealer/0.1+http://localhost:3000/Dealers'
    }
}).then(response=>{
   return response.json()
}).then(jsonResponse=>{
    if(jsonResponse){
        return ({
            title: jsonResponse.title,
            artist: jsonResponse.artists_sort,
            thumbnail: jsonResponse.thumb,
        })
    }
})
    }
};

export default Discogs;





 ruby0855699667:

I don’t understand why the state is updated correctly when I call the setState on each response


Your function currently has control over the program. The handler isn’t allowed to run until your function gives up that control so that the event loop can run new things, such as your handlers. It doesn’t matter whether the responses have arrived, the handlers are blocked from running.
And yeah implement a function that does:
Array<Promise>  -->  Promise<Array>

It’s a trivial function. If you have an array of promises, then you should be able to create an array with all the resolved results, which will necessarily be wrapped inside a promise as a result of having to wait on other promises.
async function sequence(promises) {
    const results = []
    ... // what would you need to do here?
    return results
}

I have no clue how failed requests tie into this, but I suppose that’s a separate problem anyway.
You also have a problem of making many requests. Like making many re-renders, making many requests could be considered expensive for the client and/or server. Better if you make one combined request. (Similar to how you should be able to turn an array of promises into a promise of an array, you should be able to turn many requests into request of many)




 ruby0855699667:

However, they get displayed properly after a SECOND click on the button.


Maybe this will help from Dave’s book Pure React.
""If you call setState and immediately console this.state right afterwards, it will very likely print the old state instead of the one you just set…
If you need to set the state and immediately act on that change, you can pass the callback function as the last argument to setState, like this:""
this.setState({name: 'Joe'}, function() {
  // called after state has been updated
  // and the component has been re-rendered
  // this.state now contains { name: 'Joe' }
});

“Another way to make it so that sequential state updates run in sequence is to use the functional form of setState, like this [example of a counter component]:”
this.setState((state, props) => {
  return {
    value: state.value + 1
  }
});

Excerpts From: Dave Ceddia. “Pure React.” Apple Books.

Thanks for the explanation. To be honest, I’m still not 100% clear on this…But at least I have a solution that works for now so I’ll just keep this on the side for later.
cloud7873894466>
Thank you for this!
I think I understood the part where this.setState doesn’t update the state immediately. I believe my fundamental non-understanding is about the fact that, with my method:
changeState(term){
    let idToRender=[];
    this.state.dealersDb.map(dealer=>{
    if(term===dealer.id){
        idToRender=[dealer];
        }});
    let recoToFind=idToRender[0].reco;
    recoToFind.map(item=>{
        Discogs.search(item).then(response=>{idToRender[0].recoInfo.push(response)})
    })
    
    this.setState({
    objectToRender: idToRender
    });

the objectToRender state IS updated with the new object (idToRender), but one state of this new object, namely idToRender[0].recoInfo seem to not be updated properly.
But with the fix, which calls setState everytime something is pushed into recoInfo, somehow it gets updated properly. Basically what I don’t understand is why:
push(A)
setState
push(B)
setState
push©
setstate
works, but
push(A)
push(B)
push©
setState
doesn’t. Because if it was a problem with the fact that setState doesn’t get updated immediately, then with this method:
push(A)
setState
push(B)
setState
push©
setstate
I guess C shouldn’t be available in the array, right?

132,Way to go for programming in react native,"FAQ,React.js",general,2,"
Hi! Im want to learn React Native to develop Apps (i have no interest in web development, in fact i have an android game done in AppyBuilder that i want to recode in RN); i wanna know if doing the ReactJs course has sense or really not at all to learn ReactNative, i dont understand at all if its mandatory to learn ReactJS before ReactNative or not and also is hte fact that in codeAcademy there is no React Native Course :-(.
Also I a have done the JS course up to the 9 lesson (classes)
Then class 10 Browser compatibility i will skip.
Are classes 11 (Modules) 12 (Promises) 13 Async-Await and 14 (Request) have something to do with React Native?. I explored them and they appear to be very related to web development.
I wanna know if it is worth to learn this 11-14 classes for RN or pass directly to ReactJS or another course. Not only for the time, also i dont wanna colapse my head with so many concepts that i am not going to use.
","
It depends on how much experience you have with programming and how determined you are.
I’d suggest taking all the JS courses and React courses first before moving to React Native. If you can grasp the component model and data flow in React you’ll be fine with React Native.  I’m learning React Native now and am so thankful I have a decent grasp of vanilla JavaScript and React already.
I can remember learning Corona SDK and the Lua language about 7 years ago before having any programming experience.  I was able to make an app but I was flying blind most of the time with programming concepts and just thinking like a programmer in general.  I had determination to get through it but my troubleshooting skills were very limited and hence my app was very limited.
If you’re a seasoned programmer, then jump to React Native.
If you’re a relative beginner or intermediate student, get through at least basic JS courses plus you can go check out React Native courses at Udemy (some as cheap as $12) and they make sure to make the videos for various  levels of students.

 ash-saad007es:

I am trying to export an API response to another component so I can feed it with the data from that response but every export is failing.


When we make a call to an API and the response comes back, it’s common to store the response (or some part of the response) in State.  You can then pass that State value to another component.
Here’s a quick example from the Ravenous project:
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import BusinessList from './components/BusinessList/BusinessList';
import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar/SearchBar';
import Yelp from './util/Yelp';

class App extends Component {

    state = {
      businesses: []
    };


  searchYelp = (term, location, sortBy) => {
    Yelp.search(term, location, sortBy).then(businesses => {
      this.setState({
        businesses: businesses,
      });
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""App"">
          <h1>Ravenous</h1>
          <SearchBar searchYelp={this.searchYelp}/>
          <BusinessList businesses={this.state.businesses}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;


You can see the method searchYelp helps to bring in some business data and then state is set to an array of businesses.  That array of businesses is passed to the BusinessList component.

Thank you

I have exactly the same issue (same code, same error).

You need to input search keys for both business and location, I guess you are not entering any location in “Where?” blank

Thank you for your input. The error on screen shot occurs after putting the information (business and location) and hits the “let’s go” button

Hello, just been looking through the forums for help on the Ravenous part 4 - and I see I have the exact same error message that you were getting. did you ever solve the problem? Be good to hear if you did and how you solved it. It’s driving me nuts!

I have the exact same problem. can’t figure it out at all.

Looking through some of the questions asked, and seeing them go unanswered for so long, it doesn’t appear to me that codecademy PRO is good investment. I mean, this question was asked in January and up until now there has not been a reply. Some of these project veer towards the deep end really quickly, and for newbies like me, I’d expect to come to the forums to get answers to these questions. I just don’t feel motivated enough to continue renewing my subscription. That doesn’t mean that I didn’t find it useful. I hope the moderators take note

This is super old, but was just looking through the threads and I think I may have found your problem. It was back in Ravenous part 3, Step 4. The problem is SearchBar.
You need to move the sortByOptions object into the SearchBar component and change the name to this.sortByOptions (and change the references to it in renderSortByOptions()).
When I run my code without that, it might work initially but once you click on one of the three options (Best Match, Highest Rated, etc), I get the same error as you.
According to the Codecademy, this happens because:

A user doesn’t receive feedback after clicking on a sort option
The Yelp API won’t know which results to return if it isn’t clear which sort option has been selected.

Hope this helps!

I am just wondering why you have to use ! in front of judgmental?
It seems to be producing same result with or without the !
As judgmental will be randomly generated as true or false, using ! will just flip the result.
Is there a concept I am missing here?
Thanks!

If judgemental is false then render <li>Nacho Cheez Straight Out The Jar</li>
Have you done console.log with judgemental to see what happens when the random assignment produces true?  Does the  get generated?

console.log( judgmental && ""<li>Nacho Cheez Straight Out The Jar</li>"");

136,How Many Times Should You Redo The Ravenous Project To Become Competent?,"FAQ,React.js","advanced-react,general",3,"
I’m currently learning React and in the 3rd part of the Ravenous Project. I have to admit that so far, I’m just more or less a typist, just typing in most of the code given. While I understand some of the code, I don’t understand others. This is understandable given that I am new to the framework. I just want to know, especially from others who have completed the project how it helped them and how many more times I need to redo the project in order to get fairly competent. Thanks
","
I suggest doing simpler projects after Ravenous such as a to-do list, a quote rotator, a single page website, a paper, scissors, stone game, etc. trying to use what you learned in Ravenous.    You can use Ravenous as a reference to help guide these smaller projects where you’re not being fed the instructions line by line.  You’re going to struggle a bit but it will deepen your understanding of the concepts you learned in Ravenous.
Then go back and do a Ravenous-type app.  That is, make it only for cafes or only for pizza shops.  You can call the same Yelp API but you customize it a bit to fit the specific food type.
After that, find another API (easier ones like https://api.randomuser.me) and see if you can make your own API driven React app.  Fetch the data, realize it on a webpage.
These are the kinds of things I did after Ravenous and the Spotify Jamming app.
here’s an API for Dogs: https://dog.ceo/api
Here’s an API for FourSquare which is what they used for the travel app at Code Academy: https://developer.foursquare.com/

Thanks a lot for your suggestion. I will give it a go

137,Jamming React - getAccessToken() method,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,3,"
Please support. I am kind of unexperienced in DOM and lwith a lot of effort I have almost reached the end of the jamming project but I am seriously having troubles on fully understand how part of the code from the getAccessToken() method works.
I understand that when I am running the app in the browser the “search” button will trigger the Spotify.search() method in Spotify.js which in turn will use the Spotify.getAccessToken() method to get the accessToken.
What I really find hard to understand why we are looking for the accessToken value into the current window.location.href (using .match) if we are supposed to be “parked” at the URL  “http://localhost:3000/”  ??
I hope I explained myself and you can give me some reference that can help me review some basic concepts…
Thanks,
Dennis
    getAccessToken(){
        if(accessToken){
            return accessToken;
        }
        **const accessToken_Match = window.location.href.match(/access_token=([^&]*)/);**
**        const expiresIn_Match =  window.location.href.match(/expires_in=([^&]*)/);**
        if (accessToken_Match && expiresIn_Match){
            accessToken = accessToken_Match[1]; 
            const expiresIn = Number(expiresIn_Match[1]); 
            window.setTimeout(() => accessToken = '', expiresIn * 1000);
            window.history.pushState('Access Token', null, '/');
            return accessToken;
        } else {
            const accessUrl = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${clientID}&response_type=token&scope=playlist-modify-public&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}`
            window.location = accessUrl;
        }
    },


","
I think I can answer to this for you.
First of all, how does the Implicit Authorization Auth of Spotify work?
You “build” a link with all the parameters, aka  const accessUrl
This is a link that will lead you to the Spotify Authorization page: once you (the user) agree to give access to your data, your browser will be redirected to
redirectURI
Which in this case is the localhost page, BUT there is a difference now! Normally your browser URL will look like this:
http://localhost:3000

But after giving Spotify access and get redirected, it will look something like this:
http://localhost:3000/#access_token=NwAExz...BV3O2Tk&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600&state=123

This is when the match() function comes in play: window.location.href returns the URL you have in your browser at that instance, whereas match() will use a regular expression to capture the access token from this URL.
Hope I helped!

So, this is why search doesn’t work the first time you click the button, you receive the acces token after it.
Any fix for this?

138,Setting Up React in VS Code,"FAQ,React.js",general,3,"
Bit of a strange question here: I’ve been doing the tutorials on React, I’ve set up VS Code, Git Bash, Node, all that stuff and I’m able to get my own code running to create applications.
However, I only just recently started learning React because of a group project for school. We have a github repository which I’ve cloned, but I can’t seem to test or run anything there on the localhost like I normally would. I tried doing npm start while in (what I think) is the correct directory.
Can anyone help me out and teach me how to open up the localhost page when I haven’t gone through the whole “create-react-app” process?
edit: basically, how can I run/test their components? is there some command in bash that will let me test those files that I’m missing?
","
After you clone the repo, have you run npm install in the project’s root directory in order to download all the project’s dependencies?  Then after installed, use npm start

Ya i figured that out last night after googling the issue. I guess I was just in the wrong directory when trying to use npm start initially. Thank you though.

139,The time to use bind when working with react components,"FAQ,React.js",general,3,"
Hi there,
I’am currently working on the Ravenous Project/Part 3/Task 9
Project: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/react-component-state/modules/ravenous-part-three/projects/setting-searchbar-state
Why do I need to bind this (the current class instance) to the call of handleSortByChange() to not get the Error:

Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.

On the other hand when I call the getSortByClass() on Task 8, there is no need to bind the function, although both of them are in use of this?
","
getSortByClass() is setting the name of a class attribute in the HTML so ‘this’ doesn’t really play an important role for defining ‘this’.
handleSortByChange() is setting state so ‘this’ and what “owns” the ‘this’ value becomes important.  Specifically SearchBar owns the ‘this’.  Man, I know this is confusing stuff.  Not sure how else to say it.
You should be able to call the on click handler two different ways and the ‘this’ will get defined correctly:
What happens when you call handleSortByChange() like this using an arrow function?  Do you get the same error?
onClick={() => this.handleSortByClass(sortByOptionValue)}
versus this way using .bind()
onClick={() => this.handleSortByClass.bind(this, sortByOptionValue)}
Check out a part of this article about the ‘this’ and the arrow function:



Dave Ceddia



Where to Initialize State in React
Ahh, the many ways of initializing state… It can be confusing. Do you put the state = {...} directly inside the class, or do you write a constructor and say this.state = { ... } inside the constructor? And do you need to have a constructor at all?






In short, Dave Ceddia says:
"" Another type of syntax supported by the class properties feature can make this constructor unnecessary: you can set a property equal to an arrow function, and the arrow function inherits the  this  binding of the class instance so you don’t have to bind it explicitly. […then he gives an example]""
So if you don’t use an arrow function then you have to bind it explicitly using .bind().

Thank you for the explanation and the link, it’s a lot clearer now. And yes, it is quite confusing stuff

I see a few small issues, but nothing to cause the problem you have. The issues I see will only cause issues with how the content is displayed. Here they are:
In App.js:
      <div className=""App""> <!--Double <div> Not really detrimental. Just unnecessary.-->
        <div className=""App""> <!--Double div-->
          <h1>ravenous</h1>
          <SearchBar searchYelp={this.searchYelp} />
          <BusinessList businesses={this.state.businesses} /> 
        </div>
      </div>

In BusinessList.js:
        return(
            <div className='business-list'> <!--Should be 'BusinessList' to get proper css styling -->
                { this.props.businesses.map(business => {
                        return <Business key={business.id} business={business} />
                    })}
            </div>
        );

In Yelp.js:
                    return {
                        id: business.id,
                        imageSrc: business.image_url,
                        name: business.name,
                        address: business.location.address1,
                        city: business.location.city,
                        state: business.location.state,
                        zipCode: business.location.zipCode, <!--This should be .zip_code-->
                        category: business.categories[0].title,
                        rating: business.rating,
                        reviewCount: business.review_count
                    };

Possibly the problem causing the error is in Business.js? Hope this helps a little.

Update: I commented out my own code, and replaced it with the code you have supplied. It worked as expected. No errors. Could you provide Business.js and SearchBar.js?

Same here, the code worked fine. Spotted to many parentisis on the second to last return of Yelp.js. I guess the problem must be in SearchBar.js.

It’s solved! The problem was lying in SearchBar.js like you said. Thanks for the help 

Hii harry i am also getting same error.can you give me search.js file

Please give me search .js

Please give me search bar .js file

Hope it helps:

Hello!
I’m running through the exact same issue with my code. I’m getting a
Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property ‘map’ of undefined
BusinessList.render
src/components/BusinessList/BusinessList.js:8
I’ve tried to look into my searchBar,js to find an anomaly, but I couldn’t find anything relevant…
Also, up to the end of Ravenous part 3, everything was working fine, and searchBar seemed to function well.
Just to be sure, I’ve tried to replace my searchBar.js code with the code provided by nungon above, but I’d get the same error again…
I’ll past the code of my searchBar.js file as well as my App.js and BusinessList.js as those seem to be related to the problem somehow…

I would really be thankful if someone could help me figure out what’s wrong with my code…
Thanks a lot!

I update this thread as I’ve found where my error came from, maybe it can help some people.
In step 18’s hint of the ravenous project part 4, the following code is given:
return jsonResponse.businesses.map(business => {

});

it is asked that the callback function returns an object, but according to the Mozilla developer resource website,
// Parenthesize the body of a function to return an object literal expression:
params => ({foo: bar})

Once I updated that in my code, the error was gone and it functioned perfectly.
I found this while comparing the solution code given in the next lesson with my code, and looking on google why the callback function on map had () right after the => (answer=because the callback function returns an object)

I am having this exact same problem - only putting those brackets in doesn’t solve the problem for me. If I put in my code any help would be appreciated - I’ve been looking at it for a very long time now!!

I would be sooo happy if I could get this thing to work - so many thanks in advance for any help!!

Hi!
Sorry if you have already tried, but in the code you have pasted above, in your BusinessList.js file,
I don’t see the () wrapping up the object returned by the arrow function.
Instead of:
this.props.businesses.map(business => {
        return <Business business={business} key={business.id} />
      })

you should have:
this.props.businesses.map(business => ({
        return <Business business={business} key={business.id} />
      }))

Hope this helps!

Hello!
Many thanks for your help.
Unfortunately putting these brackets in only gave another error.
I now have put the solution code in to see if that works - but it gives the same error as I had before so I think I’m going to have to give up on this one. Shame as I’ve put in a lot of time on it.
So frustrating!

Hey em. Check if your App state array is updating. The JsonResponse map method is not returning anything and has an extra set of parentheses. Here is an excerpt to validate your code with:
then(jsonResponse => {
      if(jsonResponse.businesses) { //Check if response is valid by making sure it has a businesses key
        return jsonResponse.businesses.map((business) => {
          return { //Object with valid values
            id: business.id,
            imageSrc: business.image_url,
            name: business.name,
            address: business.location.address1,
            city: business.location.city,
            state: business.location.state,

But you don’t understand why. Which is a problem. What does the -g flag do? Have you googled?



 ruby0855699667:

make sense, given what the consequence is of omitting the -g flag.
the -g flag install the package Globally, so without the the -g flag, the package is installed locally in your project. But the local package is very like not in your path.

Thanks for the fast reply!
I have actually decided to try without the -g, based on an explanation you have given on another thread, and I quote:
"" you do understand by now that  -g  means you want to install the package globally (for all users)? This does require “administrator” privileges indeed.
you can also install the package only for your current user, then you don’t need special permission""
I thought this wouldn’t create new difficulty afterwards, but it did. So the solution to this is to re-install it but globally this time? Is there a way to do so without encountering the first access error I had in the 1st place?
Thanks for your time

Even i keep learning, i would personally check the package website:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
to see what the recommended approach is. Seems to be to use npx

Thank you!
npx seems to fix the problem for now. I’ll spend some time digging into “why” 

what i know (been a while since i used npx) is that npx knows the path of the locally installed packages, making it easier to run the packages.
i think you could use npm as well, but then you get something like:
./node_modules/react/bin/somescript

or something.

Create a UI using ReactJS and SASS.
Use React to create 2 different components to append selected values on the right-hand column with the headings using Redux States (Refer Page Test1@2x.jpg)
Please make sure that if we uncheck the left checkbox then that value should be removed from the right-hand column.
When all the options are unchecked from any heading then all the values and heading will also be removed from the right-hand column.
Please make sure that if we remove an option from the Right side column, then that respective option should get unchecked automatically. (Refer page Test2@2x.jpg)![Test 2@2x|690x388]

149,Jamming Playlist component breaking the TrackList component,"FAQ,React.js",advanced-react,2,"
So my code is rendering just fine up until step 38.  The map function for TrackList’s props is working normally and the track info (name of song, artist and album) is being displayed perfectly.
However, for some strange reason whenever I add the TrackList component, even without any props, to the Playlist JSX, the map function in the TrackList component breaks. Here is the render method on my TrackList Component:
render() {


    return(
      <div className=""TrackList"">
        {
          this.props.searchResults.map(track => {
            return <Track searchResultInfo={ track } key={ track.id } /> })
        }
      </div>
    )
  }

This is the whole Playlist component:
class Playlist extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""Playlist"">
        <input defaultValue={ 'New Playlist' }/>
        <TrackList />  <------ This is what seems to be breaking the code
        <button className=""Playlist-save"">SAVE TO SPOTIFY</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

I am getting this error message now.

It says error is occurring at the TrackList component but whenever is called from the Playlist JSX.
“The above error occurred in the  component:
in TrackList (at Playlist.js:10)”
Whenever I delete the TrackList component from Playlist, the page renders just fine once more. Here is all the code within the App component:
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      searchResults: [
        {name: 'March to the Sea', artist: 'Baroness', album: 'No clue', id: 1},

  }
}

Please please please let me know if anyone has any idea on how to solve this. I have compared every single detail with the walkthrough and also with the finished project but neither seems to have the answer.

So I have since solved the issue by conditionally saving the props array to a variable like this:
    let arr = this.props.searchResults;
    let trackArr;
    if(Array.isArray(arr)) {
      trackArr = arr.map((track) => {
        return <Track searchResultInfo={ track } key={ track.id } /> }
      )
    }

I just added the variable to the JSX and it is working normally.

I assume that there have been some updates to the create-react-app command where the default App.js files gives an output like:
function App() {
  return (

      <header className=""App-header"">

The project requires us to edit the “render()” method with the app component (STEP 46). However this is no longer what the command produces. I assume the project will still work when I modify the return statement, but can someone explain why there is no an “App” component with a render function in this file? Is there a particular reason? Would this file function just fine if I replaced everything with the typical static components we have created so far?

Hello, I am working on Jamming Project. I have it set up and should be running by now, except I get the error listed above.
The big issue is I kind of got stuck and mimicked TrackList from the source code, so i am not understanding why TrackList would be throwing an error. Because of this I feel like maybe there is an error in another file that feeds into TrackList, besides Track because is also source code, but I do not understand what data TrackList could be getting because I can’t even get the webpage to pull up before this error is thrown.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and maybe if someone could go into more detail what TrackList is actually doing. I am decent in javaScript but just started working with frameworks about a month ago so this is both new and not new.

When you are using the TrackList component you are not passing in tracks, something like this:
<TrackList tracks= {[a, b]} />

You will also need to add onAdd, isRemoval and onRemoval.

Hello, @digitalplayer58973.
Welcome to the forums.
This code looks fine. You might double check your app.js file, or post the code.

First, sorry about my username. I missed to change that.
I have the same problem, but as it seems earlier in the project. I did the project twice until this point and followed the video instruction every time, only leading to this error again.
I figured that it might have something to do with binding a method which seems to be crucial in JSX. Sorry, I’m quite a newbie still.
class TrackList extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.mapTracks = this.mapTracks.bind(this);
    }

    mapTracks() {
        this.props.tracks.map(track => {
            return <Track track={track} key={track.id} />
        });
    }

    render() {
        return(
            <div className=""TrackList"">
                {this.mapTracks()}
            </div>
        )
    }
}

If anyone had that experience or knows about how binding the method would work, I’d be grateful to hear!

155,Jammming project - TrackList props are showing in dev tools but trying to use map() on them gives a TypeError showing as undefined,"FAQ,React.js",advanced-react,13,"
I’m having a problem whereby I’m getting the following error in relation to task no. 34:

Screenshot 2020-02-14 at 11.04.061043×243 22.1 KB

This is my full TrackList.js file:
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';
import Track from '../Track/Track';

class TrackList extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className=""TrackList"">
                {
                    this.props.tracks.map(track => {
                        return <Track track={track} key={track.id} />
                    })
                }
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default TrackList;

And this is the SearchResults.js file where the props are passed down:
import React from 'react';
import './SearchResults.css';
import TrackList from '../TrackList/TrackList';

class SearchResults extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className=""SearchResults"">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <TrackList tracks={this.props.searchResults} />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default SearchResults;

Before attempting to use map() on the “tracks” props I checked dev tools to be sure the props were being passed down successfully and this is what I got for props on the TrackList component:
{
  ""tracks"": [
    ""{album: \""Madman Across The Water\"", artist: \""Elton J…}"",
    ""{album: \""Love Story\"", artist: \""Tim McGraw\"", id: 2, …}"",
    ""{album: \""Lullaby Renditions of Elton John\"", artist:…}"",
    ""{album: \""Tiny Dancer\"", artist: \""The White Raven\"", i…}""
  ]
}


Can anyone help me understand why I’m getting the error?

I too have no clue and I’m stuck at the same point with the same error message.  From messing around, I have found that .map() is working at the SearchResults level (Child) but stops working at the next level down (TrackList = Sibling).  This is probably why the ravenous project works, the .map() is only one level down, in BusinessList.
Creating a new ‘state’ in SearchResults.js and populating it with the incoming props variable doesn’t help - the error stays the same.  I suspect that we may have a newer JS level and we might have to back off to a previous release.

Just chipping in to say I’m having exactly the same problem. Would be delighted if anyone can explain why the props.tracks show up correctly in devtools but give an “undefined” error when I try to access them in the code; that’s totally baffling to me.

import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';
import Track from '../Track/Track';

class TrackList extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className=""TrackList"">
                {
                    this.props.tracks ?
                        this.props.tracks.map(track => {
                            return <Track track={track} key={track.id} />
                        }
                        : console.log(this._reactInternalFiber._debugOwner.type.name)
                    )
                }
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default TrackList;

If you try the above, will it render anything at any point?  If not, it should write the name of the parent that called it in the console, what is the name of it?
Without the whole project, it is hard to see the data flow and speculate, especially as you as using dev tools it shows a value. How many places have you used TrackList or SearchResults?  It possible one of them is not having the correct value passed into it so it becomes undefined, or search results becomes undefined somehow.

Thanks for the reply. I’ve moved on to subsequent lessons, but I will backtrack and give this a try soon. I’ll post the results if anything useful comes of it.

I have the same issue.
Interestingly though, when I console log(props.tracks), it shows up, but THEN it console logs again as undefined (without me even repeating the console log call).
It’s as if props.tracks starts off as defined and then becomes undefined.

I was getting this error a lot throughout writing the whole app, for various reasons.
A lot of times I found that its caused by functions not being set up correctly (for example not having “this” bound, not referencing objects correctly, etc) which in turn makes them return undefined as their value.
As @jagking said its hard to figure this out without the whole project.
Best of luck!

Hi @jagking
Initially I got an error but in moving the console.log() line outside of the map() parentheses, this now works!
Thanks very much for your input. Is there anything more you wouldn’t mind sharing to explain what’s happening here as I’m not following the reason for getting the error vs. not?
If it helps, here’s the full project: https://github.com/gideongoddard/jammming

Ops my bad, yeah the console log part was meant to be outside of the map.
What that is doing is if this.props.tracks is falsey (such as undefined) it will log what component created the tracklist component otherwise it will render the track components.
If you look at your console in the browser you should see where the issue is.
? : Is a ternary operator, it’s just shorthand for if else. ? Runs if true : runs if false.

If I use the ternary operator like you’ve done, it both renders the Track components AND console logs ‘Playlist’.
I’m glad that it’s rendering the Track components, why would love to know why it’s console logging ‘Playlist’ as well.
There must be a reason why this.props.tracks is truthy initially and then undefined. There’s something to be learnt here but I don’t know what it is…

You’ve answered the question for both of you.
Look at your App.js.  In your render you have a Playlist element, correct?
You also have this on it playlistName={this.state.playlistName} yes?
Where is this.state.playlisyName defined?  If it is like @gideongoddard’s code then it isn’t.  And in Playlist you   have this line <TrackList tracks={this.props.playlistTracks} />, right?  So now you can see why it becomes undefined.
So it have a value when TrackList is used in SearchResults but then it renders the PlayList and that is when that instance of the TrackList component gets a this.props.tracks that is undefined.  Remember, you have 2 individual TrackList elements with their own props being passed in.
If multiple people are getting here from following the same material, either the material isn’t clear on what you should be doing or it is wrong.

Awesome, thank you so much, I get it now 
I think the tutorial needs to be updated slightly to prevent people getting this error.

Thanks @jagking, absolutely get this now.
When following the guidance of the tasklist, you hit this issue before the tasks to define playlistTracks that will then get passed down so it could be more helpfully structured.
Really appreciate your explanation though.

156,Learn ReactJS: Part 2 - Video Project - menu select not working,"FAQ,React.js",stateless-components,4,"
Hi Everybody!

      </div>
    );
  }
}

","
Look where this.handleClick is.
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp form does not have a value attribute.  So chooseVideo will be having undefined passed into it, so nothing else after that point will work as expected.  You need to move the onClick.

Hi! Thanks for having a look at this, after spending some more time on this I found that the handleClick function was working correctly. The issue was a syntax error 
In App.js my setState function read:
this.setState = ({ })

Instead of what it should have been
this.setState({ })


What I said will be valid for clicking anywhere in the form element that isn’t the radio button.  I.e. whitespace or the text.  So you will probably want to change it still.
Good spot, completely missed the assignment.

Hello,
Why we use this localhost:3000 instead of using html file path ? I know nothing about localhost:3000 ??
","
Localhost will typically be 127.0.0.1 however it could be different.  Basically it is your machine.  3000 is the port number it will communicate on.  It is pretty much an arbitrary number, so long as it isn’t clashing with something else.  Your website is being hosted locally in your machine  on port 3000.

Hello,
The question is about this exercise : this
import React from 'react';

  'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-1.jpg',

];

export class GuineaPigs extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { currentGP: 0 };

    this.interval = null;

    this.nextGP = this.nextGP.bind(this);
  }

  nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;
    let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
    this.setState({ currentGP: next });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    let src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP];
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <GuineaPigs />, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);

I figured out how nextGp() works . it setState everytime method runs to setState new index of 
GUINEAPATHS and setState automatic render call start and page change

But how we call nextGP() automatic ? what is usage of
 componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 1000);
  }

If I delete 
componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

It still fuctions correctly .
","
I’m on my phone so can’t see the whole exercise but:


componentwillUnmount is only called when the component isn’t needed anymore, it is for cleaning up anything that depends on the component and without it there won’t work properly anymore.  So cancelling network requests, timers etc. In your case it is clearing the interval timing event with clear interval, otherwise it would try call the nextGP method on a component that doesn’t exist.


componentDidMount is called after the component is made but not shown on the screen.  This and componentWillUnmount are called lifecycle methods and are called by React automatically at given points of the lifecycle (which is indicated by the method name).


nextGp is called every second.  setInterval is a method that will run the first argument (this.nextGp) every X period of time in milliseconds (1000 ms or 1 second in this case).


Point 1 should really have been after 2 and 3, sorry.

why we Did not used  () when calling nextGp inside setInterval ?
componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 1000);
  }


Because you need to give it the method itself so it can be called when needed.  If you put () after nextGP, it would call the method once and the result of that method would be passed into setInterval.  Because nextGP doesn’t explicitly return anything undefined will be returned, obviously, if you pass undefined in then it can’t do anything with that.

160,How should you be calling methods in react? Ravenous pt3,"FAQ,React.js","components-interacting,general",2,"
My problem is with how methods are being called and I’m not sure if this is react specific or just javaScript in general.  if you check all the way below where the form is there’s a bunch of moments where I call my methods and inject them into render method. Why do some of the methods calls only work if it has () attached to the end and other method calls only work with out (). For example “this.renderSortByOptions()” has parentheses but ""this.handleTermChange "" doesn’t.

      ""Most Reviewed"" : ""review_count""
  }

A basic answer is when you use () after the function you are calling it there and then, so the side effect / result of that function will occur then.
When you do it without the () you are passing the function into something else to be called at a later date, when it decides it should - that maybe straight away or in the case of the events (onChange for example) it will be when the event occurs.  You you are passing a reference to the function not the result.  There cases you may still see () when passing into something else.  In these cases either:

The function is being called because it will then calculate the required value.
2), It is a higher order function and will return a function themselves.

E.g:
function scenario1() {
    let result = 10;
    // Maybe do some conditional logic to result.
    return result;
}

function DoStuffWithAFunction (func) {
   func(10);
}

DoStuffWithData(scenario1())
DoStuffWithAFunction(scenario2());

These examples are really simple, so not the best but show cases you will use () on a function when it is being passed into another function.
On that note, it is worth noting that with the onChange etc props on the elements the function you put in it are getting added to something else to be called at a later date.  So here you want a reference to a function.  this.renderSortByOptions() you want that to run right away because it is returning an element you want to be rendered.

161,Why we use component notation?,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,3,"
Hello ,
When we want make a new Instance of class component we use  notation(outside of React) . while component is a class that extends React.component super class , I think we should use :
const myComponent = new [name of class we made out of React.Component]  [name of object] ;
to make an object from class ,
how this relate to < /> notation ? is this still an object ? is this notation Specified for React.js and only React.js  could understand it ?
","
when I try use this I get and error .
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this._behavior = 0;
    }
    incrementBehavior() {
        this._behavior++;
    }
};

class Dog extends Animal { 
    render() {
        return <h1>hey</h1>
    }
}

const baby = new Dog; // Why we use <Dog /> is React.js instead of creating and object like this ?

console.log(baby.render()) // unexpected token <


but If I don’t use  It returns
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this._behavior = 0;
    }
    incrementBehavior() {

class Dog extends Animal {
    render() {
        return `Hey`
    }
}

const baby = new Dog;

console.log(baby.render())  // returns Hey



those tags are not part of javascript, you’d need an additional compilation step to turn tags into js code

162,Jammming question wording,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,1,"
Could someone give me some clarification on question 63 of the Jamming app?




In  App.js  create a method called  savePlaylist  with the following functionality:

Generates an array of  uri  values called  trackURIs  from the  playlistTracks  property.
In a later step, you will pass the  trackURIs  array and  playlistName  to a method that will save the user’s playlist to their account.

What exactly are they asking me to do here? I feel like the wording is a little odd.

Could someone please help me figure out how to fix this issue? Thanks!
Also there happens to be this “;” in the business list area that I can’t seem to find in my code but appears when i run the project. Any idea of where this semicolon might come from? Trying to get rid of it.

Hi there!
You might have more luck posting in the Javascript/React specific category for help. I just happened across your topic while exploring the forums. Just trying to set you up for success! 
Back to your code, off the bat, it looks like you have a typo in the constructor. You have best-match, I think it should be best_match (at least that’s what I have). Also, I’m not sure you need the semicolons after your closing method brackets in the class. These should be separated by line breaks. But, this could be an optional thing…I’m still learning how strict react is and coming from strict JS back in the day. 
sortBy:'**best-match**'

handleSortByChange(sortByOption){
        this.setState({
            sortBy: sortByOption
        });
    }; <---- Remove closing semicolons from the function closing brackets inside the class


Your first input for search businesses should handle the term change, not the sort change. This is if a new keyword is searched for, not changing the way it’s being sorted, if that makes sense.
<input placeholder=""Search Businesses"" onChange={**this.handleSortByChange**}/>

For your search button, remove 'href=“www.#.com”. This is not needed with the onClick setting as we execute the search via the API.
<a **href=""www.#.com""** onClick={this.handleSearch}>Let's Go</a>

Hope this helps get you in the right direction! And of course, these are recommendations based on the code I can see.

Thank you so much for finding those errors!!! It definitely helped me get a little closer to having a working program.
Removing the 'href=“www.#.com” resulted in the program to compile with warnings:
./src/components/SearchBar/SearchBar.js
  Line 87:  The href attribute is required for an anchor to be keyboard accessible. Provide a valid, navigable address as the href value. If you cannot provide an href, but still need the element to resemble a link, use a button and change it with appropriate styles. Learn more: https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md  jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid

Sadly after those changes were made, more errors came up that I can’t seem to fix . I’m checking my code with previous ravenous solutions and other people’s posts but i still can’t seem to find the issue.
I also still cannot find the problem to the random unwanted ‘;’ in the business list area.
Would you, or someone, happen to know what went wrong here?
Thanks!

Thank you again for the help! i appreciate it a lot (-:

You bet! Debugging helps me understand the code. You’re helping me too!
Your BusinessList.js matches mine except for the semicolons. I only have one to close the return (); in the class.
return( /* Iterate through array and return Business components */
            <div className=""BusinessList"">
            {
                this.props.businesses.map(business => {
                    return <Business business={business} key={business.id}/>;
                })
            }; <--- remove
          </div>
        ); <--- keep
    }; <--- remove

In App.js your searchYelp looks a bit off with the closing }'s. I think you may have an extra set. Remove the ones around businesses. I suspect this is why your search isn’t working.
searchYelp(term, location, sortBy){
    Yelp.search(term, location, sortBy)
    .then(businesses => {
      this.setState({businesses: {businesses}}); <--- extra {} should be {businesses:  businesses } here
    });
  }

in Business.js, you might be doing it a bit differently and that’s ok! I’m still learning too and props are not my strongest, but this is what I see:
class Business extends React.Component {
    render(){
        const {business} = this.props; <-- I'm not sure this does what you want, but I see this as trying to eliminate repetition. I do not have this in my code. That doesn't mean it's wrong though - just an observation. 
        return(
        <div className=""Business"">
            <div className=""image-container"">
                <img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/ravenous/pizza.jpg' alt=''/>
            </div>
            <h2>{business.name}</h2>
            <div className=""Business-information"">
                <div className=""Business-address"">
                    <p>{business.address}</p> <-- for each of the business items I have this.props so this would be {this.props.business.address} If you get the issue above working, you might not have to change this section. If not, I'd remove the above variable and add this.props to each item in this section. 
                    <p>{business.city}</p>
                    <p>{business.state} {business.zipCode}</p>
                </div>
                <div className=""Business-reviews"">
                    <h3>{business.category}</h3>
                    <h3 className=""rating"">{business.rating} stars</h3>
                    <p>{business.reviewCount} reviews</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        );
    }
}; <-- remove this, but again... not sure it matters. 

Let me know how it goes!

oh my GOSH thank you so much! 
Both of the problems I had are gone!
I didn’t have to change anything in Business.js, but the changes you recommended with BusinessList.js and App.js helped fix everything!
Deleting the ; in between the divs eliminated the random ‘;’.
Deleting the extra {} helped the errors go away!
Thank you for all your help!!!
I really appreciate it.

Excellent news! Happy to help! And thanks for letting me know what fixed the issue.

Hey y’all,
I know this is an old post, but I’d like to share my code for anyone to compare against. I followed Codecademy’s ravenous project Part 4 instructions (as of February 2020)  and managed to get it running. I fixed some errors/typos myself following @jdrmiller suggestions… so thanks for that!
Anyway, take a peek, compare against your own code and hopefully you’ll get your project up and running in no time.

why should I set the input value to the userInput property
i.e. if i’ve just set userInput equal to e.target.value in the setState function shouldn’t this do it when i set the h1 tag innertext to userInput…?
then why do i need to set also the input value property again to userInput…

Hi Susano,
you should set input’s value attribute to control an <input /> ‘s text and make it responsive to this.state.userInput .

168,Calculating the average number in an array of objects,"FAQ,React.js",react-components,3,"
So I’m creating a project using my skills in React.js. My project is a book review SPA that allows users to navigate different components that provide information and reviews on a certain book. in the parent class component I want to display a stats component that is above the header and contains important information like how many reviewers made a post and what is the average rating out of five stars for that book. I know I need to create a callback function and pass it down to the stats component; I also know how to get the average number in and array of objects using the map and reduce method. The problem is I don’t know how to get the average number and then put in the callback function. I will post my code down below.
problem code:
/*My helper functions. I have an accumulator function and a 
getRating function that gets all the ratings inside my array of objects*/

  reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => {accumulator + currentValue};

  getRating = () => {
   return this.state.UserReviews.rating
 }

/*I use the map method to extract all the ratings from my array of objects*/
 const ratingScores = this.state.UserReviews.map(getRating);

/*I add up all the numbers in my array by using the reduce method*/
 const addScores = this.ratingScores.reduce(reducer, 0);

/*I then devide all the added up numbers by the length of the array.*/
const averageScore = this.addScores / this.ratingScores.length;

  reviewScore = () => {

      this.setState( prevState => {

That it was well-written and hard to put down. She specifically mentioned that it had very little of the gratuitous sex that seems to pervade the TV show. On her recommendation, I bought the book and completely agree with everything she said.
  Even though it is difficult not to imagine the faces the actors when reading the book, it is still an awesome read. Much more detailed than the series, but also enhanced by it to a certain extent.

But before I could watch the first few episodes of the first season, I had to read the first book. And that's exactly what I did! And you know? It was most rewarding. Personally, for me, reading about Arya Stark turned out to be more fun than watching her on the show. Same goes for Jon Snow and Lord Eddard Stark. But the one that I was really hooked on, next to Snow, was Tyrion Lannister. An educated soul among a very masculine, not-so-educated family. I really can't understand how I did not hear of A Song of Ice and Fire when it was out in the 90s. I CANNOT!! Anyway, after reading far enough into the book, I started the series. And the rest is history. It is way beyond The Wizard of Oz. No disrespect intended.`,

hi Paine8887,
congrats on your new project.

I think you should use averageScore as the second property of your {state} object:




 paine8887:

state = { UserReviews: , averageScore: ‘0’}




you can put all the computing of average number inside the function reviewScore()  ;


Then





 paine8887:

reviewScore = () => {


here goes the computing of averageScore;

this.setState(  {averageScore: averageScore: })
}



finally to call the function you can use componentWillMount():



componentWillMount() {
this.reviewScore();
}



in the render() use the updated average:




 paine8887:

render() {
return (
…
…
averageReviewScore={this.state.averageScore}
)
}



Thank you. So I created I created a new  property in UserReviews object and successfully passed it down. The result I get from reviewScore function is NaN so I need to work on that. heres what i have so far in my reviewScore function
  reviewScore = () => {


                //My helper functions. I have an accumulator function and a
                //getRating function that gets all the ratings inside my array of objects

              const  reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => { return accumulator + currentValue};

              const  getRating = () => {
                 return this.state.UserReviews.rating
               }

              //I use the map method to extract all the ratings from my array of objects
               const ratingScores = this.state.UserReviews.map(getRating);

              //I add up all the numbers in my array by using the reduce method
               const addScores = ratingScores.reduce(reducer, 0);

              //I then devide all the added up numbers by the length of the array.
              const averageScores = addScores / ratingScores.length;




      this.setState( prevState => {

        return {averageScore : averageScores}

      })



  }


  componentDidMount() {
    this.reviewScore();
}

Hi @rubyrunner76763 could you send the full source code for your project. Even just the App.js file is fine since it seems it is not being defined.

import React from 'react';

A template was not provided. This is likely because you're using an outdated version of create-react-app.
Please note that global installs of create-react-app are no longer supported.

I already tried reinstalling Node and redoing npm install -g create-react-app. I got a bunch of other errors then - could try reproducing those if it helps in advising me.
I also tried that sudo command TO mentioned, but it didn’t fix the problem for me either.
I’d love to be able to FINALLY work on the Jammming project 
Could you please guide me step by step so I can install it properly and create a new React app? I’m completely lost at the moment.

install xcode

Try this. It worked for me.
npx --ignore-existing create-react-app jammming

Hi, i’m also facing the same issue. you got any fix? 

@willemijnbb8 my guess is that you, like myself, updated your Mac OS to Catelina in the last few months. Almost every time I update my Mac OS command line tools become non-cooperative. Usually running xcode-select --install will fix any issues but when I tried it this time I got this message:
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use ""Software Update"" to install updates

This article led me to a solution.

Long story short:

Get the path to the location of your command line tools

xcode-select --print-path


Remove them from your system. If the result of running the command above is /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools, run

sudo rm -r -f /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools


Reinstall command line tools

xcode-select --install

Hi, jnoweb!
Your issue is in App.js: when you render Menu, there is a typo in the function name which you pass (choosevideo instead of chooseVideo):



 jnoweb:

<Menu chooseVideo={this.choosevideo}/>

174,React:Ravenous Part 1 Picture bug,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
When changing the icon on the first step, I keep getting this error:
Failed to compile
./src/components/App/App.jsModule not found: Can’t resolve ‘./logo.svg’ in ‘(Just user names and stuff)\src\components\App’
The step just asked to replace the old picture with a new one and rename it, which i did exactly. I looked into Logo.svg and its a whole lotta numbers i dont want to change. Any ideas?
","
I think this has to do with a few conflicts within the instructions themselves. The reason why this breaks the way it does is when you are instructed in step 6 to create the App folder and move App.js and App.css into it. What happens here is that App.js contains the line “import logo from ‘./logo.svg’;” which means that it is looking for that file within the same folder that contains App.js, which is the newly created App folder. I don’t know if this is the “correct” answer or not, but what I did to resolve this is to move the logo.svg file from the src folder to the App folder, and when I did that it brought everything back up just fine.
This could be the wrong thing to do, but at the moment it is working for me without any problems yet, so hopefully this will help!

Lol thank you so much! I just skipped that step and hoped all the code i wrote was correct. Made life so much easier

Very helpful they should maybe add this in there can confuse a lot of people if they are new. Although if you are this far in you are not new.

176,Why do we use map for looping in reactjs but not the for loops(why don't they work)?,"FAQ,React.js","react-components,general",2,"
Why doesn’t the normal loop work in react and we end up using the map method?
For example, consider this code
import Counter from ""./counter"";

If you’re asking why something doesn’t work you better show it. My first guess would be you didn’t do something that resembles what map means. For example, maybe you discarded all the results, in which case it shouldn’t have taken effect in any way.

I have a state in App.js that contains some songs… I pass it to another component SearchResults which passes it to Track component… This is where the problem is. I can type ‘console.log(this.props.searchResults)’ and i can see the array of songs on the console.
But if i put it in the return statement like this:
import React from 'react';
import Track from '../Track/Track';
import './TrackList.css';

class TrackList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log(this.props.searchResults);
    return (
      <div className='TrackList'>
        {this.props.searchResults.map(data => (
          <Track />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default TrackList;


It says ‘TypeError: this.props.searchResults is undefined’
How can it be defined in the console.log and undefined when i access it in the return statement???
I hope i explained that well!!!
Thanks in advance for any help…
Edit:
So i am passing state from App to SearchList… Then SearchList props to TrackList…
When i log props in SearchList it shows one object with the passed state.
When i log props in TrackList it shows 2 objects!!! one with the passed array from SearchList and one which is undefined!!!

Okay so i found the problem… I was calling TrackList from another component also… which is why it was getting 2 objects for the props… My question now is if my component is receiving props from 2 different components how do i access the one i want??? or is that possible??

I can’t say exactly why you can access this.props.searchResults from your console.log() statement, but it is undefined inside your return statement other than the obvious that it’s an issue of scope. That aside, you shouldn’t be using this.props.searchResults.map() above. You should be using this.props.tracks.map() so that each element of the tracks array is rendered as a Track component. See instruction #34.

Hi sorry for the late reply… I got the issue sorted… It was getting 2 props becuase it was getting called from 2 other components… Turns out my problem was just me not understanding how it worked… Cheers for the reply though… And Merry Christmas!!!

sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules


it? who? certainly not npm, it even advises against it in your error message (and it is not appropriate)
In any case, that’s not the directory that the error message mentions, so it wouldn’t matter. So the first step would be to read the error message, what does it say is wrong? It mentions a directory. Which? Should you have permission to do that? If you should have permission but don’t, then what happened? Were you using sudo previously to mess up your permissions? That’d be my first guess.
when you get permission denied that’s usually saying you’re doing it wrong. doing it wrong with admin isn’t less wrong, it’s more wrong. so instead of forcing the wrong thing, reconsider and then do the right thing, typically using a different location where you already have permission
since the directory mentioned is something you should have write access to, that implies your permissions are messed up, you’d need to undo that. ~/.npm probably doesn’t contain anything you care about (packages that are easily re-obtained), so if you delete it you’ll also be getting rid of anything in it that has bad permissions set to it. since they have bad permissions set to them you’ll probably need to use sudo to get rid of it, and after that you probably don’t want to use sudo for anything else.

this “advice” probably has to do with npm install’s -g flag for installing things globally. the default location is system owned which means, no, that’s not where they should go. instead, what should be done is to specify an appropriate location to put things that don’t belong to projects

I found out that I was doing it in an area I probably shouldn’t have I didn’t use sudo I ended up doing
npx create-react-app
in a directory I want to build the app in. It didn’t really explain that in the instructions well and someone that replied to me said to just use the command on any directory and it wouldn’t hurt that’s why I got that error. I ended up making a new directory on desktop and it worked

closing git bash should kill the process? You could check what process is using the port:
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

then grep that process:
ps aux | grep PROCESS_NAME

then kill it:
pkill -f PROCESS_NAME

careful with the -f flag. You could also use kill process_id, maybe better
also, next time use the interrupt signal (ctrl + c) to terminate npm start

Thanks, stetim94! That worked!
I just did not know about control c.

I’m not seeing how this isn’t proper use of the map() .
I’ve checked that my props are being passed correctly to my TrackList component.
My state is working because I’m seeing my hardcoded values.

Hi David, I think I can help. I ran into the same problem. Then I recalled that I saw this type of message before, although in a different context. I got this message often when I started JavaScript one or two years ago. It should read "" X is not a function at …"". It means that what you pass in as an argument is not the proper data type. The map() function works on arrays. So somehow, your this.props.tracks is not an array (probably an object).
I could solve this in the following way: In SearchResults.js:
<TrackList tracks={[this.props.searchResults]} />
I got no more compile errors after this point, though I am not as far as you are.
Regards,
Frank.

Thanks so much for getting back to me. I figured it out in the end in the end thankfully. I was using map() on something that wasn’t an array, a silly mistake but now I know.




 ruby_mcpython:



Hi David,
let me add that my suggestion makes the error go away, but it won’t help as you complete the app. The data must be an array right from the beginning, that is,when it is defined in App.js:
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = {searchResults: ,
playlistName: ‘blubber’,
playlistTracks: ,
};
Sorry, but I hadn’t figured this out when I answered your post.
Regards,
Frank.

So I am working through this article. I am currently on the 3rd step where you open the src/App.js in a code editor on your computer. However, I have no idea where this file is. I cannot seem to find it anywhere. I am assuming it was created when I installed everything and started the new app. The thing is, I cannot find any of it on my computer. I am using a Mac and am running the latest version of the OS. Could somebody please help me figure out how to locate this file?

185,Need Help making a timer auto-start in React Native,"FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
Hello, I am working on a coffee app that has recipes for making different types of coffee drinks. With each step in a recipe that is timed, there is a pre-set timer that the user pushes and then for then next step the user has to manually push the next pre-set timer. I have seen other coffee apps where the next timer will start automatically for the next step and I would like to implement in this app.
I have been searching for quite awhile for tips on how to do it but I can’t find anything online. Does anyone know how I might implement this? This is the code

Hello, @obbes, and welcome to the forums!
In your BusinessList component, you have this line:



 obbes:

return <Business business = {this.business} />



Try removing this. You need to set the <Business /> property  business equal to the parameter of the map function. It’s just business not this.business.

Hey there, I just created my very first, own react app: https://rondio.website/
There is a sub-site: https://rondio.website/landschildkroete
The function works fine but I have an issue with the routing.
If you go first to the main page and then navigate to the sub-site per header link, everything works fine. But it isn’t working just by inserting the sub-site url directly to the browser. Someone told me it might be a server problem but not react.
I purchased my domain and the server on namecheap and publish my react-app by inserting the latest build in the ‘public_html’ folder.
Can anyone help?

Please check the browser’s console in the Developer Tool.

Hi there,
I’ve got the same issue with you. Did you manage to resolve the issue? Any suggestions is appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!

Hi, according to the API documentation,
https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
When you send a request to the /businesses/search endpoint, the location parameter is “required”.
So, please check your Yelp.js, make sure you are sending a request like this format,
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=${term}&location=${location}&sort_by=${sortBy}


Thanks so much for your reply! It turns out that it was an & missing in my Yelp.js! Now, it works

@alyssavigil, are there any React coaches who might be able to chime in on this?

Upload your code to GitHub so we can see your Yelp file (and other necessary ones)

Zannain noted on Slack (and I agree) that your .then() should be an arrow function, to preserve the “this” that setState is referring to. Try .then(businesses => { this.setState({ businesses: businesses }) })

I changed to an arrow function to no avail. I have uploaded to GitHub:

Thank you.

Inside your search function inside your Yelp file console.log the response you get back from Yelp and see if you’re getting what you think

I am now getting the following error:

Screen Shot 2018-11-02 at 11.26.31 AM.png1053×565 52 KB


Do console.log(jsonResponse.businesses) right under the line “if (jsonResponse.businesses) {” and tell me what it console logs. That’s what you’re trying to save to your state so lets see what it is exactly you’re getting at that point.

That would be line 13 in Yelp.js according to the file i can see on GitHub

I believe I may have solved it. Looks like my issue was within my jsonResponse.businesses.map. ‘category’ was set to category: business.categories, when it should have been category: business.categories[0].title
Does that sound right? The app seems to functioning now.

Ah! yes. Mind says “business.categories.title”. When I get funny results I console log the whole api response and see what exactly I’m trying to save and if it’s in the format I’m expecting.

Thank you so much for the help. While I have you here, one last question. What is making it so it only shows the first 20 results?

Probably yelp has a default limit and you’ll need to figure out how they paginate in order to get more.

Okay. Thank you. Really appreciate the help! 

Their api docs say by default they return 20 and the max is 50 https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search

Perfect. Thanks again!!

Yours…

i haven’t personally done this, but seems router was specifically created for this purpose:
https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start



 milan77:

Do I need Express?


No, react can work with any REST point api. This can be written in express, but also with plenty of other languages and frameworks.



 milan77:

Do I need the webpack knowledge?


Yes, browsers do not understand React. It needs transpiling to Javascript.
i would use create-react-app:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
that saves a lot of setup headaches.

Sure but what do you mean by open?
As a developer you can pretty much forget about clicking buttons to do things for you. So instead of open you need to be considering which program you want to be reading that file which would most likely be either a text editor or nodejs
And if you can’t click buttons then I’m not sure windows is all that useful, consider using wsl instead (windows store -> ubuntu)
If you use wsl then you can access its files from windows by entering \\wsl$ as the address in the file explorer gui which is how you’d get access to your files for your text editor

Inside wsl the first thing you’d want to do is install nodejs and npm
$ sudo apt update    # update package index

195,Codecademy browser not rendering,"FAQ,React.js",general,9,"
I logged on today, using Chrome, and completed 2 lessons. The entire time through the lessons, the codecademy browser on the right would not render any code. I pushed ahead anyway, but now I am on a video player project, and would really like to see my code rendered. I have tried using both Chrome, and then Safari, but same issue. When I initially load the page, the video player is there, but once I hit “run” it disappears, which (according to the steps) it should still be there after I hit run.

Update: I just downloaded FireFox (which, since their update, is pretty sweet), and attempted again on a third browser, but nothing. Three different browsers, still no render. could this be an issue on the Codecademy side of things?

Hello ,
That’s really unfortunate 
Please have a look at the trouble shooting guide:




Troubleshooting Guide Support


    There are a number of things you can try if you are having trouble loading, viewing, or submitting exercises. 
Reload the web page
This takes care of a majority of problems. 
Check your Internet connection.
We recommend that you have a reasonably fast connection to the internet. Any broadband connection, like DSL or cable, should be sufficient. 
If you are at work or school or using a shared wireless network, there may be a firewall or proxy that is interfering with your connection to Codecademy…
  



I saw the troubleshooting post shortly after submitting this post. It didn’t help out. I have a pretty wicked fast internet. Solid connection. Refreshed on each browser. I can’t seem to figure it out.

I will try and escalate it/get a response but from your side, in the lesson click get help and report it.

Thank you. I’m heading to bed now, but will do tomorrow if the problem persists.

Hi @kotadev
Apologies for the inconvenience.

197,Convention for naming fetch response variables,"FAQ,React.js",general,1,"
I’m working on the Jamming project and currently developing the Playlist Save feature (Step 89).  When having multiple fetch statements in sequence, especially in this exercise, should we be reusing the response variable or should I create separate variable names for readability?  I just want to know best practices. Any critique on any other of my code welcomed as well!
For example, there are 3 fetches in my save savePlaylist method:
async savePlaylist(name, uris) {
    // Reuse response and jsonResponse variables?
    // Get user from Spotify
    let response;

    response = await fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/me`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    });

    const user = await response.json();

    // Create a new playlist
    response = await fetch(
      `https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/${user.id}/playlists`,
      {
        method: ""POST"",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,

        body: JSON.stringify({

    const playlist = await response.json();

Looking at the console on the loaded webpage there is a similar error -

  17 |             );
  18 |         });
  19 |     }

I have checked my code for actual syntax and reference errors (repeatedly) and all seems fine. Doing a bit of google research I have seen that some users found it to be related to the babelrc part of the React app and versioning. However this goes beyond my current scope of understanding… any other users had similar issues or any admins who can help?
Thanks in advance!

Hi! Can you post your full code sheets for these two files? It’s hard to debug without seeing the full code that’s being executed. So much is intertwined.

Hi thanks so much for trying to help however I’ve actually just figured out where it falls apart. Step 47 states that

create-react-app command creates a default App component for you. It includes a render() method

for whatever reason this was not the case with my install, which just used what I assume to be updated/or outdated(?) syntax -
function App() {
            return (
                            ......
                        );
}

export default App;

Changing this to the class type syntax made the difference…

Of the code you posted, the comment above is the only error. It’s not causing your problem. Need to see Business.js.




 enwafor:

this.props.businesses.map((business) => { return  })


see if it works by wrapping  business with parentheses.

this is in your businessList.js, forgot to mention.

here:
at new Script (vm.js:83:7)

do you have a file named vm.js? Check line 83, seems to be a problem with a semi-colon

There is a vm.js in the modules, but it only has 36 lines of code.

no very obvious other errors in the stacktrace… i need some time to research this

To make a wild guess since you’re not providing a way of reproducing it…
jsx compiles into javascript, doesn’t it?
so after compiling, it would look different. there may very well be more lines after that step
If you know it’s a rogue semicolon within 36 lines then that’ll take you about as many seconds to look through. And even if it didn’t, you could look at the compiled output and cross reference it. or figure out how react developers debug their code.

204,What are controlled components?,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
What are some examples?
","
Hello @codingperson51867872 !
In HTML, form elements such as <input> ,  <textarea> , and  <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. When a user submits a form the values from the aforementioned elements are sent with the form. With React it works differently. The component containing the form will keep track of the value of the input in it’s state and will re-render the component each time the callback function e.g.  onChange  is fired as the state will be updated. A form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
With a controlled component, every state mutation will have an associated handler function. This makes it straightforward to modify or validate user input.
I hope this helps =)

Hello, welcome to the forum 
It is not a good idea to share your API keys, never. API keys are just like passwords. I edited your post.
It looks like your code is correct. I see only one problem, take a look at this line:
const url = 'https://www.wanderlust.com?near=';

Quote from the step 3 of the instructions:

Create a  const  called  url . Check the Foursquare documentation to see the  explore venue  API endpoint.
Add the  near  parameter without a value. To add a query to the end of a URL, be sure to use  ?  followed by the first key ( near ) and an  = . You’ll add the value of the  near  parameter to this URL string when you make the request itself.

Open the linked documentation article:

Request
GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore

This means that if you want to communicate with the Foursquare venue API endpoint you have to change this line of code to:
const url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?near=';

209,Ravenous - Copying in CSS code given,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/ravenous-part-one/projects/create-prj-components
I find this tutorial work method kind of Unrealistic…
First, we are asked to create Business and BusinessList Component.
We don’t get to see it in the localhost window to see what exact is happening.
And Code Academy tells us to copy/paste in CSS codes for those components.
In the real time projects, we wouldn’t be working such way…would we?
In real projects, Business and BusinessList should be shown on screen first (without CSS) and adding css files to see how they change after applying css.
I was hoping to follow the tutorial not just learn the code but how it would be done in real.
I just don’t see it real how CSS is added when elements are not even showing up on the screen yet.

I think there is a chance you need to work that way. Since it is not definitive you will be working alone there is a high chance you need to work with models where you don’t know what it will do. library’s often work like this.
Also the beauty these lessons show is that design and functionality are completely separated as it should be. A program should still be able to work fully without any visual representation.
Also a visual representation should work without a program behind it (of course you would need make-up data).
All it should do is talk with each other when something has changed.
This idea is based on the MVC architecture.
Most of the times it is not needed to know what is happening in a function you use. Knowing what will come out of it will be enough to use it. Take for example Math.random, I still have no idea what is happening in that function but boy have i used it.

I don’t think this is the case. In a real project these things have nothing to do with each other. A designer knows what kind of data will be shown so they make a design around it, this does not mean the data already exists. In the mean time or way after the design is ready the functionality of the project can be made.

213,Ravenous - total from fetch API,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
Link to project: https://github.com/jkey774/codecademy-ravenous
I have been trying for a few days now to add a new feature to my ravenous app that displays a results total for number of businesses retrieved. I can console.log(jsonResponse.total) just before mapping each business but am unsure how to set this up to where it can be accessed in App.js to do something like:
in Yelp.js
const Yelp = {
  search(term, location, sortBy) {
    const limit = 21;
    return fetch(`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=${term}&location=${location}&sort_by=${sortBy}&limit=${limit}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`
      }
    }).then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    }).then(function (jsonResponse) {
      if (jsonResponse.businesses) {
        console.log(jsonResponse.total);
        return jsonResponse.total;
      }
    }).then(function (jsonResponse) {
      if (jsonResponse.businesses) {
        return jsonResponse.businesses.map(function (business) {
          return {
            id: business.id,

Hi Katie,
Could you please share the code of Parent Component of SearchBar (where you’ve  rendered  it)?

Hi,
Thanks for getting back to me.
App.js code:
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SearchBar from './components/SearchBar/SearchBar';
import BusinessList from './components/BusinessList/BusinessList';

const business = {

  zipCode: '10101',
  category: 'Italian',
  rating: 4.5,
  reviewCount: 90
};

const businesses = [business, business, business, business, business, business];

class App extends Component {

  seachYelp(term, location, sortBy) {
    console.log(`Searching Yelp with ${term}, ${location}, and ${sortBy}`);

Hey @katie2899,

I also had this error but for another reason. In app.js I had forgotten to add the attribute:
searchYelp={this.searchYelp}

215,Ravenous part 4 - features to add to Ravenous,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
Hi everyone,
I try to do the list of features to add at the end of ravenous part 4.
One of them is saying “Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again” .
So i put searchYelp()  to access the Yelp API  in my handleSortByChange method like this :
handleSortByChange(sortByOptionValue) {
        this.setState({
            sortBy: sortByOptionValue
        });
        this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
    }

Is it the good way to resolve this ?
Because when i test and click on a sorting option, my businesses change on the page but not like it should be…ex: Highest Rated will not be in the good order with all the 20 businesses (only a few of them will work…this a very weird).

handleSortByChange(sortByOptionValue) {
this.setState({
sortBy: sortByOptionValue
}, () => {
this.props.searchYelp(this.state.term, this.state.location, this.state.sortBy);
});

Thank you, I was so stuck on this step!
I had to lookup the  (setState documentation to understand that what you did is add the optional callback function.
But without your answer, I wouldn’t even know to look for it.

on your computer or in the lesson?
permissions can’t be turned of, they are so deeply embedded within the operating system
what you can do is change the permission to grant your user/group to the files.
i first recommend checking who currently has permission:
ls -l

and then use chown or chgrp to give yourself the right permissions. If you need more help with these commands, let me know, but also feel free to google

In each of these methods, you just need to delete the =. setState() is a method, so you use it like this:
this.setState({sortBy: sortByOption})

Likely, it’s just a warning from your code editor regarding the <a></a> element not having a href attribute. I use Visual Studio Code, and get the same warning, but everything still runs fine. I’m not sure why they use the combination of <div><a></a></div> instead of a <button></button> with the same className and onClick attributes. Might be instructive to try changing it, and see what happens.

Thanks for the reply! The error actually comes up in the ‘developer tools’
There should be a message logged but nothing shows up:
searchYelp(term, location, sortBy) {
    console.log(`Searching Yelp with ${term}, ${location}, ${sortBy}`);
  }

I did try to change it to button after looking up ways to troubleshoot it, but still the message doesn’t show.




 bsomekh:

this.handleTermChange = this.handleTermChange.bind(this);
this.handleLocationChange = this.handleLocationChange.bind(this);
this.handleSearch = this.handleTermChange.bind(this); } //Look here for an oops..



Looks like you may have copied & pasted, and forgot to change the value for binding this to handleSearch 
If I had a dollar for every time I made a similar boo boo…

Oh boy 
It worked! I always try to keep a look out for errors like these, they still slip by me for now…

Each object in the array is related to one specific restaurant that has multiple properties, and each one of them (restaurants) will be passed as props to <Business /> from <BusinessList />, with something like:
<div className=""BusinessList"">
  {this.props.businesses.map(business => <Business key={business.id} business={business}/>)}
</div>

So in <Business />, this.props.business is related to one single object of the initial array, and to retrieve its location you must go to its location property that holds an object whith adress1 as property (check the link with the example of one restaurant object) there is no address property in the business object, so…this.props.business.location.address1.
Hope I made some sense and helped.

I encountered similar problem.

Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.

configuration.module.rules[2].oneOf[1].include should be one of these:

<a>Let’s Go</a>


Does it only break in your post at this point, or is that something to consider for your code in general?
<a>Let's Go</a>

the ' needs to be \' instead, maybe? Since it looks like it’s starting a string that never gets closed.
Besides that, there’s a difference in the equality operators == and === namely: abstract equality and strict equality. I can’t trial and error debug this atm, got no test environment for react set up. So that’s my input on it. Hope it helps 

Hey ! As far as I’m aware, the' shouldn’t be an issue, since it behaves as it would in an HTML file.

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/your-first-react-component/exercises/render-react-component?action=resume_content_item
Why do we initialise a class the following way
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);

instead of
  <{MyComponentClass} />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);

since MyComponentClass is a javascript object and we are supposed to use {} on Javascript variables in JSX. Thank you for your help in advance.
","
Step 8 of that exercise explains why.

JSX elements can be either HTML-like, or  component instances . JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two!  That  is the React-specific reason why component class names must begin with capital letters. In a JSX element, that capitalized first letter says, “I will be a component instance and not an HTML tag.

<MyComponentClass /> is HTML-like, therfore it’s not in curly braces 
(Did I get that right?)




 coderighton:

(Did I get that right?)


One would expect so. { expression } would not be HTML-like, since we do not use expressions as element types. Tags denote type selectors.

I don’t have access to the lesson (because I don’t have Pro), but the error directly tells you permission denied. What do you think that means?  It tells what you should do about the problem.

Hopefully you followed all the instructions and tried the command with sudo since you have a permission error.. I have no access to the lesson and just noticed your “newer” post you created. 

I should have been more specific. I don’t know how to grant permissions where they are needed to make this run.

add sudo
sudo npm install -g ......

Awesome, that worked. Looking up “sudo” command now. Thanks!

Weird, I’m admin on this machine, not sure why I didn’t have permissions. . . but it is working.
Also, this is what displays when entering $PATH. Is it possible that I changed the directory of install to a python folder? Not sure where this thing is suppose to live - as in what directory it should be housed in.

Im pretty bad at JS but when looking at this I don’t see what this.props.tracks is because the error says:

Maybe try looking closer at your this.props.track, it says its “undefined”

239,React - how to find parent component of props,"FAQ,React.js",,1,"
Hi, I am currently taking the Codecademy intensive course on React.JS, it is going well so far!
I am now working on creating and passing properties between components.  I understand the basic mechanics, but one thing I haven’t figured out yet: how does one track the source of a component’s props that were set in another component?
In the exercises it is easy as we have generally worked with only two or sometimes three components, but imagining a large application with many components, I am not sure how I would find the parent component where the props were defined and passed into the child component (assuming I am viewing the child component).
Is this something I can expect in upcoming lessons, or something I have overlooked? Thanks, Jason

240,REVISITING - TypeError: Cannot read property map of undefined,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
Hi! I’m revisiting an old question that wasn’t resolved and I’m unsure where I took a wrong turn. I’ve searched extensively and can’t seem to find an answer for this so I’m hoping that someone on here can help me.
I’m doing the Ravenous exercise in the "" Building Front-end Applications with React"" section of the Web Development Path. When I click on the “Let’s Go” button to execute a search and send a request to Yelp’s API, the request completes just fine and I can see the data return via the network in the dev tools. I’ve even logged out the custom mappings that I’ve created. However, it never maps to the state’s business array and hence never renders the results.
Some posts on Stack Overflow mentioned that the BusinessList component is rendering before the results are returned and to try using a conditional to ensure that this.props.business is truthy before rendering. However, this does not work as console.log(this.props.businesses) returns undefined. Leading me to believe it’s not setting the state correctly.
Can anyone help me figure out why the code does not work?
This is my code below
import React from 'react';
import './BusinessList.css';
import Business from '../Business/Business.js';

class BusinessList extends React.Component {
        render() {
        return (
        <div className=""BusinessList""> 
        {
        this.props.businesses.map(business => {
        return <Business key={business.id} business={business} />
            })
        }
        </div>
        );
}
}


export default BusinessList;


import React, { Component } from 'react';

    super(props);
    this.state = {
      businesses: []
    };
    
    this.searchYelp = this.searchYelp.bind(this);
  }

  searchYelp (term, location, sortBy) {
    Yelp.search(term, location, sortBy).then(businesses => {
    this.setState({businesses: businesses});
    });
 }

  render() {
    return (
            <div className=""App"">
        <h1>ravenous</h1>
        <SearchBar searchYelp={this.searchYelp} />

I was having trouble here as well. I tried making the Yelp.search method in Yelp.js an async function with try/catch block but it didn’t fix it. It turns out I misspelt ‘authorization’, omitting the ‘h’ in there and it worked.

These are the instructions>

Inside of  Child 's render function, give  <select>  a new attribute.
Make the attribute’s  name onChange . This will create an  event listener .
Make the attribute’s  value  equal to the function that you passed in from  Parent.js . If you can’t remember what  prop  name you used, then check  Parent 's render function.

Hi, @straychris
I can’t follow to the link, that you provided, but I have few suggestions.

Your Child has this.changeName, but changeName is defined in Parent, so should be visible by props : this.props.changeName.






 straychris:

Make the attribute’s value equal to the function that you passed in from Parent.js


Not sure, but I guess you need to add to select one more attribute value that equals to the name that you passed from Parent:
<select id=""great-names"" onChange={this.props.changeName} value={this.props.name}>

Now your element knows how to update state with new name using onChange attribute and what option should be selected with value attribute.
Hope these points will help you with solution.

244,Why double equals instead of triple?,"FAQ,React.js",,6,"
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/this-state/exercises/call-setstate-another-function
Is there a reason that in React methods that rely ternary operators or if statements, the curriculum shows double equals instead of triple?  I thought triple were generally best practice.
","
The double equals is coercive, and does not assume matching data types. If anything it uses more resources than the strict type matching ===, but in the case above the data may be loosely typed. This would have the effect of not throwing an exception if a different data type is passed into the comparison. It would just result in a return along the false branch of the ternary.

Hmm, what sort of example would the data not be a string?

Hypothetically speaking, mind. In this instance the object is hard coded, but in a dynamic situation the values may be set by a user or arrive from a data store. Loose typing in a ternary is a safeguard against an exception being thrown.

I think I follow.  Maybe an example could be if for some reason a single-item array containing an identical string were passed in, you would want to be able to coerce that.

I’m afraid my explanation may not be doing this topic any justice. A mismatch of type will not throw an exception, but simply yield false (or the default branch of the ternary). Hopefully this has given you reason for thuoght and extra reading so you sort it out in your own mind.

you want to install a package globally (-g) with user privileges. That will certainly produce an error
this raises a question:
Should i install the package globally?
If so, give additional privileges to the installation.
If not, don’t attempt to install the package globally.
the error displays a user friendly message:
please try running this command again as root/Administrator, indicating a privilege problem.

I tried to install the package without -g (globally) but it did not work.


have you first initialized a new npm project? If you don’t want to install globally, you install per project

Can you please explain what additional privileges? And how I can add it to installation.


running this command again as root/Administrator, that is pretty big hint? If you don’t understand how mac is handling privileges and now you can elevate your privileges you should spend time studying it. Otherwise you might end up with a structure which is not ideal for your project

248,"Can you explain ""this.intervals=null"" in the App.js file? Exercise 4/7","FAQ,React.js",,3,"
I was under the impression that the only things that need to be declared in a constructor are this.state and binding methods. So i can’t understand why this.intervals has been declared here. Is it arbitrarily declared or is “intervals” a pre-defined object in React.components with certain properties that can be called on?

 bkwillia052gmail.com:

I was under the impression that the only things that need to be declared in a constructor are this.state and binding methods.


where did you get this impression? Do you understand what the constructor does?
interval is part of Javascript. But declaring the interval in the constructor gives us a way to verify that the timer hasn’t been started yet.

Because the second List’s children is not an Array, because your if statement checks if this.props.children is an array

250,Questions about the solution,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
Please help me understand as I am new to React and can’t grasp the pattern just yet.
I have 2 questions:

On parent.js file,  changeName function is defined like this:

changeName(newName) {
    this.setState({
      name: newName
    })
  }

My question is, what does the parameter “newName” means and where does it come from?

Also on Parent.js file’s render:

  render() {
    return <Child name={this.state.name} onChange={this.changeName}/>
  }

Why does the attribute “onChange” equal to {this.changeName} even if in the Child.js file, it does not call the changeName, instead it calls the handleChange(e) method in the  tag.
I cannot visualize the pattern just yet, please help me understand. Thank you.
Here is the link : https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-102/lessons/child-updates-parents-state/exercises/automatic-binding?action=resume_content_item
","
Somebody help please


New name is the import to the function of changeName.
changeName is a function whose job is to change the state of ‘name’ to a new value which is newName.
The reason onChange equals to {this.changeName} is because we want to pass the function onChange as a prop to the ‘Child’ component

Hi @ok45sg1205511349 k45,
If it helps, below is an updated version of your code: Please note comments.
Further below that is one possible solution.
Please note IMPORT declarations have been removed.
function coinToss() {
// This function will randomly return either ‘heads’ or ‘tails’.
return Math.random() < 0.5 ? ‘heads’ : ‘tails’;
}

const pics = {

doggy: ‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg’
};
let img;
// if/else statement begins here:
{if (coinToss === ‘heads’), //You have an opening curly brace before IF that shouldn't be there.
img = (
     //In here should be the JSX element representation you wish to display when the coinToss is heads
    //please see final solution below
);
}else{
img = (
    //Same for this assignment: This should be the JSX for image. Also below :)
);

The following is just the code you pasted updated, to try and give a comparision.

254,Question about eventhandler function syntax in 7,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
I’m currently on chapter 7 about “this.props”. The task is to move a function inside a class to act as a eventhandler. The original code was the following:
  function handleEvent() {
    alert(`I am an event handler.
      If you see this message,
      then I have been called.`);
  }

Moving this code into the class and building it works fine. However when looking at previous examples, eventhandlers does not have the function keyword. That is like this:
  handleEvent() {
    alert(`I am an event handler.
      If you see this message,
      then I have been called.`);
  }

And this code seems to compile just fine. What is the difference between using and not using the function keyword?
","
I believe its just short hand. I ran into the same curiosity in the same Chapter. I want to say it also has something to do with declaring a function outside of the class component as a pose to inside the class component.

its not just a shorthand, function handleEvent is fine on its own, but not as part of a class or react component. If we look at the documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions
we see two ways to define a method (methods are functions inside a class). You need to use these ways, otherwise this keyword will never bind properly, causing problems.
Yes, the code runs fine. But its invalid syntax, if function handleEvent ever needs access to this, then you bound to have problems. So use valid method syntax.

255,14/16 What tells i to incrememnt,"FAQ,React.js",,6,"
Apologies if this has been posed before, but I’m confused by this exercise.
I wanted to know the value of i that was making up a unique key, so I ran my own code to actually display the value of i, and noticed that it was essentially just an integer that incremented for each list item, so it appeared as
‘Rowe1’
‘Prevost2’
‘Gare3’
I just wanted to know what is it that causes the value to automatically increment, since ‘i’ is not declared anywhere else in the code.
Just for my understanding, and help would be appreciated.
Thanks
","
Please post a link to the exercise.
If there is a loop, then i is declared in the loop parameters.

This is the final result for the exercise.
import React from ‘react’;
import ReactDOM from ‘react-dom’;
const people = [‘Rowe’, ‘Prevost’, ‘Gare’];
const peopleLis = people.map((person, i) =>
// expression goes here:
{person}
);
// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render({peopleLis}, document.getElementById(‘app’));
        
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/react-jsx-advanced/exercises/jsx-keys?action=resume_content_item

map() is an iterator that returns a new list mapped over and computed from the old list
const peopleLis = people.map((person, i) =>
  // expression goes here:
  <li key={'person_' + i}></li>
);

// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleLis}</ul>, document.getElementById('app'));

i (the second parameter) is a placeholder for the internal index kept by map().

This error is because you’ve used the name of the method from Parent.js, instead of the attribute name you gave it when you passed it down to the Child.
The attribute in the select should be onChange={this.props.onChange}
I also had this problem. I think the wording of the instructions makes it unclear for someone who has only seen the functionality once before earlier in the course.

Arrow functions do not have this in their prototype. Could that be the problem?

Hello Thanks for replying. I think the error message is saying that there’s an error with map. When I remove the this, a different error appears.




 designwhiz85404:

    return (
      <div className=""BusinessList"">
        {this.props.businesses.map(business => {
            return <Business business={business} key={business.id}/>
          })
        }
      </div>
    );



Arrow function works as expected.
  searchYelp(term, location, sortBy) {
    Yelp.search(term, location, sortBy).then(businesses => {
      this.setState({businesses: businesses});
    });
  }

Not so sure this one is going to work. I’d be surprised and as it would turn out, ill informed if it does.
... .then (function (businesses) {
        // this.setState ... is exposed in a function literal.
    });

262,4.1 instructions unclear,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
I spent a long while trying to figure out what I was doing wrong when writing…
onChange={this.props.changeName} 
instead of…
onChange={this.props.onChange} 
to try to complete this step.  The text seems misleading when it says:

Make the attribute’s value equal to the function that you passed in from Parent.js. If you can’t remember what prop name you used, then check Parent’s render function.

This lead me to think I was supposed to call the same function name from props that I passed in from Parent.  I’m still a React beginner, but I believe it would be better to say something like:

Make the attribute’s value equal to the attribute name that you passed in from Parent.js. If you can’t remember what prop name you used, then check Parent’s render function.

This is probably not the right place to make suggestions like this, but figured it was worth a shot.

bind() makes the method accessible by this, so that needs to be in the constructor, so the binding occurs

return can only be used inside a function or method, which you do not have if you use a for loop.

what should i use instead of return?

its not that simple, we are dealing with react components. You could make separate components. But using .map() is better and easier

Hey Scriptmaster, there’s almost no reason to use a for loop, you’re way better off with using .map.
Is there a reason you wanted to use for?

And honestly, Just for fun i gave it a go.
const people = [""Rowe"", ""Prevost"", ""Gare""];
let peopleToReturn = [];

const peopleLis = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    peopleToReturn.push(<li> {people[i]}</li>);
  }
  return peopleToReturn;
};

// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleLis()}</ul>, document.getElementById(""app""));


Basically I put the for loop inside a function, looped over your array and inserted the names into a new array then returned the new array with  the list tags…
This is not recommended at all!
Use .map

@derknez  Yes, I just wanted to try out how  to do this using for loop instead of .map function.
Thank you for giving it a go, So the  .push method is the key here. Thanks

-g means you want to install this package globally, this does indeed require additional privileges.

(Which isn’t really something appropriate to do - install such things under your user instead)
Lacking permission to do something doesn’t necessarily mean more permissions should be obtained, could also mean doing something else (programs can’t really tell you what you want, up to the user to consider the situation)

True, which is why i only informed the user what -g means, they can then consider what they want to do.

I don’t understand what you’r talking about…




 mboushab:

I don’t understand what you’r talking about…


Be more specific. There’s no easy/accurate way to reply to that.
What you ought to be doing right now (or before asking, really) is carefully reading the error message and obtaining an idea of what is going on. Error messages are there for reading.
And after that you might ask questions to fill any gaps you might have (again, be specific about what you want to know)
Followed by considering your options. Since it’s a permission error that leaves you with two simple options: do something else or get permission
After making a decision about what to do, you can start thinking about how to carry out that action.

I want to create react app

that might be so, but why would you want to do a global installation?

I don’t know the difference, I’m just following the course. They demand to do global installation

One of the most important aspects of programming is understanding what you are actually doing. If you really want to go for the global installation, you should opt for giving additional privileges on the npm install command




 stetim94:

YES, I KNOW.
AND MEAN I don’t know  if I’ll need the global installation in the next project.

IF YOU DON’T KNOW THEM YOU CAN SKIP MY PROBLEM

I think we’re simply of different attitudes on who should be solving the problem.
From our perspective it’s up to you to ask questions so that you can solve it yourself.
If you instead use the slack channel set up for that program, staff is likely more willing to skip ahead to a solution.

272,3/7 (shouldComponentUpdate) unclear,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
I have a question about 3/7 chapter (shouldComponentUpdate) in that fine course.
Let us go to Instructions. 2
In that point one defines that line of code
shouldComponentUpdate (nextProps, nextState){return this.props.number != nextProps.number;};
Explanation why it works is that it “return false when a target has already rendered, and is about to repeat the same number as its last render. This will cause Target to cancel its update.”
I must admit  - I do not see WHY that line is expected to have THAT effect. Could I ask for simple explanation? Sorry, but I am quite new to IT.
Regards
Kiszuriwalilibori
","
A comparison (this.props.number != nextProps.number;) will return a Boolean value (true or false)
when shouldComponentUpdate returns False, reactJS stops re-rendering the component. Whoever designed that function/method build it in such a way that we can stop a component from re-rendering if we want.

The point of all of that code is just to say 1, 2, 3, 4.  It seems to me there has to be a much clearer and simpler way to do this where the code would be much more readable.

 bushbass:

what code? If you refer to code, including it can be very useful.
If this is an exercise, please also include exercise url

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-102/lessons/container-presentational-components/exercises/container-presentational-components-apply
  nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);

Why is this to complicated? I don’t see the problem, the modulo operator ensures that after we had all images in array, it goes back to the first image

Yes Home is being rendered to ‘app’ but so is App in the final exercise, and changing the name to Wolfgang Amedeus Mozart has no effect because (as I understand it) Home is not being exported or called in the other components in anyway.
So i guess what i really want to understand is that is there anyways these compenents exchange conditional data( or are supposed to) with each other than through ‘export’ and ‘import’? … For instance by a
ReactDOM.render(""**Component**"",document.getElementById('**to same app**')
call in two discrete files?
Apologies if this is a bonafide silly question 




 weltering:

the confusing thing here is that the exercise provides two files (Home and Welcome) with examples, and 2 files (Greeting and App) you actually need to work on. In essence, you have two apps here.
and it seems the example files do not render, although normally they would. Home would normally render fine.

this is not really common, but the exercise felt the need to provide an example it seems.

278,Syntax error(?) while creating a react application,"FAQ,React.js",,6,"
The article on creating a react application instructs me that, to create a React application, I should run the following in the terminal:
create-react-app <name-of-app>
So, with my next project likely to be named Ravenous, I ran the following in my terminal:
create-react-app <ravenous>
and got the following error message:
bash: syntax error near unexpected tokennewline`
Now, as far as I understand, the newline character in Javascript is \n (or is it different in JSX?) Now, I see no hint of `\n’ anywhere in what I typed in my terminal. Has the syntax changed since the article was written?
","
the use of < and > in bash redirects stdin and stdout, they shouldn’t be part of your command
<> are sometimes also used in documentation to display a value which needs replacing (like the name of an app)

I’m sorry if there’s been some misunderstanding. I may not be looking carefully, but I see no < and > anywhere in create-react-app <ravenous>. There must be some other reason.

Never mind, I ran the command without the <> and it’s working.

i see < adn > around ravenous? The > will attempt to regulate the flow of stdout, but its not pointing anywhere, which is why you get an error

279,Where is a track with this lesson in context of React.js?,"FAQ,React.js",,10,"
Hey there, fellow communtiy members! I finished all the ReactJS tracks I could find but there are no lessons on Babel or Webpack setup I see here in the latest ReactJS forum category sections! I really feel the need in learning how to setup Babel and Webpack and in some sort of final project.
","
There are plenty of tutorials online you can find to set up webpack. I highly recommended them.
Here is what i did:
npm init

then:
npm install webpack -g # install global
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env  babel-preset-react react react-dom webpack-dev-server --save-dev

webpack-dev-server you don’t really need, but you can use it to serve your webapp during development.
then for webpack.config.js:
module.exports = {
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [{
            test: /\.jsx?$/,
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            exclude: /node_modules/, 
            query:
            {
                presets:['react']
            }
        }] 
    }
}

then in index.js i simple render the app:
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './components/App.jsx'


ReactDOM.render(
    <App />, 
    document.getElementById('root')
)


then <App /> being defined in a different file.
i don’t think there is a course on how to set this up, its also a good learning process to find this out on your own.

Thanks a lot! It looks like what I’m asking for!
Also I found a series of articles called React Setup: Part I - V starting with this article:
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i
which seem to be somewhat outdated.
It also seems like there is a more up-to-date article concerning the same idea and this is awesome:
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-create-a-react-app
Though, React.js is not the easiest subject of all and it is an extremely good idea to have a final project to apply all the skills.
Again, there is a project called Jammming  which can be easily found on Google. But sadly somehow it is not mentioned anywhere in the React JS course.

JSX content is HTML, so within the HTML a <!-- --> comment should be valid. Be sure it is inside the wrapper DIV and not before it. That would be my guess, without testing.

Have you tried casting?
let number = ""1.23""

let float = Number(number);

If a prop is indeed a number, JavaScript will attempt coerce it to a Number in a math expression…
console.log(number * 3);    //  3.69

This is not a sure fire way, though. What about addition?
console.log(number + 4);    // 1.234

Casting is a bit more deterministic.

286,Why does onClick use makeDoggy and not makeDoggy()?,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function makeDoggy(e) {
  // Call this extremely useful function on an <img>.
  // The <img> will become a picture of a doggy.
  e.target.setAttribute('src', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg');
  e.target.setAttribute('alt', 'doggy');
}

const kitty = (
	<img

		alt=""kitty"" 
                onClick={makeDoggy}/>
  	
);

ReactDOM.render(kitty, document.getElementById('app'));

The onClick attribute of const kitty is set to the function makeDoggy. To do this, you have to indicate you are using Javascript hence the {} brackets. However, the correct answer doesn’t using the standard function call: makeDoggy() and instead uses makeDoggy.
Also, the makedoggy function has an e parameter. When does that parameter get passed and how can a call to makeDoggy be made with a nonexsistent parameter when the function requires one?

its explained here in the docs:

no, because e is the event, which is click, so reactJS/javascript handles this as well for you. How nice of react
if you need to pass additional information to the event, its also explained in the docs i linked above

289,Paragraph Explanation Request,"FAQ,React.js",,5,"
Hello, I am having a bit of trouble understanding this text.

The first step to making a propType is to search for a property named propTypes on the instructions object.

Am I to assume that most people who code in react will always have a propType declaration for each component and if they don’t its best practice to make one? When you say search for it I am also assuming that means I should look for it in the source code. Sorry but I am really confused by this paragraph. If you can explain like I’m five that would be great.
Also what do you mean by instructions object ?
Thank you.

Not seeing any commas after the methods…

None of the examples in 3/5 use commas after the methods?

Can’t say, haven’t got that far yet. Do the instructions say to write that alert where you have it? Of course it is going to run before any rendering, it’s before the return statement.

Yes, that is why I bring it up. I believe there is an error in the instructions. We shouldn’t put the Didmountcomponent function before render when we want it to appear after render. When does ReactJS part 3 come out? Also, why is there no distinct course saying this is React Native and not regular React when this is for mobile apps not web apps?

","
Function always have to be called in order to execute
Please share your code and exercise url so i can find the exercise and run code, so i can have a look and explain it further

// Function is declared below.
function coinToss () {
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';
}

const pics = {
  kitty: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};

// Below is a ternary form of 'if statement'. I don't see a function being executed. Is it executed once it goes inside the condition brackets?
const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;


here:
const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;

there is a function call on this line (coinToss())? I don’t see a problem, the result of the function call is used in the ternary operator.




 ellesense:

<img src={pics[coinToss() === ‘heads’ ? ‘kitty’ : ‘doggy’]} />;


Break this down to its elementary parts…
<img src=... />

is JSX stored as an ES global constant, const img = ....
src={...}

An unquoted React.js expression declared in the src attribute value.
pics[key]

An object earlier defined with two keys, ‘kitty’, and ‘doggy’. Their values are URI’s to associated images.
coinToss() === 'heads'

A boolean expression that compares the return value of a call to coinToss to a string literal. This boolean is the conditional, one of three parts to a ternary expression.
coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy'

Depending upon the boolean, if True, kitty will be the key used, else doggy is used.
In simplified form, we get…
<img src={pics['kitty']} />

or,
<img src={pics['doggy']} />

which of course resolves to ,
<img src=""https:// ... /react_photo-kitty.jpg"" />

or,

296,How to pass multiple input fields between parent / child?,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
I wonder ho to pass multiple inputs? In the coding exercise its always just 1 input field, but what if its multiple? The code below wouldn’t work for gulp. inputs…Thanks!!
 handleChange(e) {
   const name = e.target.value;

}
","
Are you referring to multiple input fields using the same handler?
handleChange(e) {
   const name = e.target.value;
   this.props.onChange(name);
}

The above code captures the value of the input field. To let the function work with multiple fields, capture only the control, and not the value. That will give us a target node, which we can then identify to direct flow through one function or another.
const targetNode = e.target;
if (targetNode.className === ""..."") {
    this.props.funcName(targetNode.value);
} else
if ( ... } {

} else {

}

More of less. If the field has a placeholder attribute, that can be used instead of the class name.

Thanks for the quick response! How do i know which privileges I used? I did not configure anything, i just ran that command as instructed.

that depends on the command you ran, what command did you run?
if you ran the command without sudo (superuser do), you have normal user privileges of your Berglund user account, which seems not to have permission to write to /usr/local/lib/node_modules directory

Massive thank you! That solved the issue

not important that the issue is ‘solved’, its much more important you understand the environment, understand what permissions are and so on

you use setInterval:
// GuineaPigsContainer.js
componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
  }

setInterval is a javascript function:



MDN Web Docs



WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setInterval()
The setInterval() method of the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. It returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it...





which sets an interval, after the time of the interval is expired, the nextGp property:
nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;
    let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
    this.setState({ currentGP: next });
  }

gets called, given you designed this property/method in such it a way, it will change the state, this is reflected by the picture changening

Thankya so much for the reply, it really helped me ! But I still have some doubt.


So because of the setInterval() , the nextGP() will be called and this will change the state and so the second pic will be set as the currentGP. But for this to displayed, doesnt it need to call the render() method? how will the render() method will be called again?


componentWillUnmount() : When will this method be called? is it after displaying all the 4 images?
And, when the task of displaying of all the 4 images is done, how will the control goes back to the first pic again?



if we look at the docs:



reactjs.org



React.Component – React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces





we read:
setState() enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state
so setState is handling the re-rendering.
also in the docs:



reactjs.org



React.Component – React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces





willUmount is called when the element gets removed from the DOM, which doesn’t seem to be the case. However, having willUmount is a very good idea to clear an interval when the element get removed from the page



 swathikanduri:

how will the control goes back to the first pic again?


this line:
let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;

is responsible for that. If you learned the basics of JavaScript, you should understand that when the index exceed the array, the modulo operator will cause next to become 0 (first index of array)

What does mounting/unmounting mean exactly?
And, as all the 4 pics are being displayed continuously, why do we need to call the clearInterval() method?

Mounting and unmounting  are very fundamental principals of ReactJS, surely they must have been taught? Its also in the documentation i provided earlier:



reactjs.org



React.Component – React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces





These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM
its all in the documentation i provided. Learning to read documentation is very important



 swathikanduri:

why do we need to call the clearInterval() method?


well, if we ever want to unmount the pictures, we need to ensure the interval is cleared, so by already adding this method, we code defensively making the code more maintainable and less prone to bugs and changes.
currently, the unmount doesn’t occur, so clearInterval() actually never gets called/executed

Hi ! Thanks for the quick reply.
I have gone through the docs earlier, but i didnt understood that mounting/un mounting means inserting/ removing a component from DOM tree structure.  Now i got it .

Its in the docs 
so all clear now? No more questions?

Please give me any suggestions to resolve this.
Thanks

I assume you’re trying to complete steps 29-35. I’ve got as far as step 34 and this is the code I have for Tracklist.js:
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';
import { Track } from '../Track/Track';

export class TrackList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""TrackList"">
        this.props.tracks.map(track => {
          <Track track={this.props.track} key={track.id} />
        })
      </div>
    );
  }
}


Unfortunately, this returns the following error:
Failed to compile
./src/Components/TrackList/TrackList.js
Line 10:  ‘track’ is not defined  no-undef
If and when I figure this assessment out, I’ll post the solution here. It will be appreciated if you can do the same should you beat me to it 

So I got to the bottom of this. My code is as follows:
import React from 'react';
import './TrackList.css';
import { Track } from '../Track/Track';

export class TrackList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className=""TrackList"">
        {this.props.tracks.map(track => <Track track={track} key={track.id}/>)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}


Turns out I needed { } surrounding all of the code in the TrackList div. I also didn’t need ‘this.props’ prepended to ‘track’, as I wasn’t receiving this information from another component, but rather declaring it inside of the .map() method.
A small fix for a lot of head scratching!

The reason my app was getting the error was because TrackList is called in SearchResults and Playlist but had not been defined yet for Playlist.

look at line 1, you have <> before your import, that might cause trouble. Suggestion: remove the <> Otherwise, could you copy paste your full code to the forum so i can actually run it? As you see, the error might not always be where you expect it 

That was it! Thank you!

the error message might look terrifying, but it can contain useful information:
SyntaxError: /home/ccuser/workspace/react-101-react-components-advanced-jsx-render-function-calculations/app.js: Unexpected token (1:1)
it says that in our app.js on line 1, column 1 (so first character on first line) is unexpected. Hope this helps you in the future as well 

It looks terrifying indeed! But thank you for noticing that detail. I will pay attention next time.

Hi there,
I’ve hit a bit of a stumbling block, details of which you can find here:




Ravenous III Project Help React.js


    Hello, 
I’m having an issue completing the third part of the ‘Ravenous’ project in the ‘Introduction To React’ section of ‘Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch’. 
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/ravenous/projects/setting-searchbar-state?program_content_id=5fe061937ce47fef67b4972a34a0ebbb&program_id=3741d64c939020a6d8549ca8d434318e 
I’ve got as far as Step 8, i.e. Set the Class Name of a Sort Option, and I’m getting the following error message in my app: 
Failed to compile 
./src/comp…
  

I’m sure I’m missing something obvious, but can’t see it.
Any help you can provide will be much appreciated.
","
It’s OK. I realised that…
return <li className={getSortByClass(sortByOptionValue)} key={sortByOptionValue}>{sortByOption}</li>;

Needed a ‘this’, i.e.
return <li className={this.getSortByClass(sortByOptionValue)} key={sortByOptionValue}>{sortByOption}</li>;

I followed the example a little more closely than does your code.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const fiftyFifty = Math.random() < 0.5;

// New component class starts here:
class TonightsPlan extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let action;
    if (fiftyFifty) {
      action = 'out WOOO'
    } else {
      action = 'to bed WOOO'
    }

    return <h1>Tonight I'm going {action}!</h1>;
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <TonightsPlan />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);

Your code will work but the SCT may not be expecting… {fiftyFifty}.

310,Collapsible treeview using React,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
I am trying to make make a collapsible treeview using  react but I am unable to expand/collapse the child nodes when parent node is checked/unchecked. The reason why I am choosing this approach is because I want to make the tree generic such that it takes data with different attributes as input and prints as data[i] like in arrays instead of this.props.data.title. I would appreciate some help and corrections to create collapsible treeview.
export default class Treeview extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visible: true
    };
  }

  toggle = () => {
    this.setState(
      {visible: !this.state.visible}
    );

  render() {
    var node = this.props.data;

      <ul>
        {Object.keys(this.props.data).map(key => {

311,Component Rendering In Action - Browser Won't Display Content,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
Exercise:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/components-render-each-other/exercises/component-render-action?action=lesson_resume
I see someone else asked this back in April, and the person who answered said you had to add module.exports = NavBar; to the bottom of the file, but I don’t see that anywhere in the instructions (like they claim), and it doesn’t work anyway.  So what gives?  Why is the browser not displaying anything?
Here is my code:
ProfilePage.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {NavBar} from './NavBar.js';


class ProfilePage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>

      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
	<ProfilePage />
  document.getElementById('app')

Im having the same issue

Me too. I got the bug as well

Yeah I’m having this issue too.

Having the same issue. Won’t even let me skip/proceed. Stuck 

I reported the bug, to get pass the exercise, just run the code several times, then a popup should show: having trouble? press get code, this will get you passed the exercise

Any solution for this issue?

same here, great start^^

Yeah, this works, but the same issue repeats for all the following exercises…

I reported the problem, i will let you know when there is an update

I have this issue with every exercise. And if I hit ‘get the code’ for all of them, well, it kinda beats the purpose 

yes, but when i wrote this reply, i didn’t know the problem persisted throughout the track, that is why i reported the issue, and will inform of any updates.

I’m having the same problem. Had the same problem months ago when I tried it before. Surprised that the problem still exists- thought they would have worked the bugs out by now. Thanks for reporting it and looking into it.

Same issue… makes the site almost unusable. 

I am also having the same problem and have submitted a bug report on my own from the lesson. Similarly, this issue of the correct code not passing the run tests have persisted through other lessons. I have tried things like resetting progress of this course and clearing my browser’s cache and cookies but all, unfortunately, have not fixed the issue. Any update will be appreciated!
EDIT: I noticed that test.js is an empty file with no text. I’m curious, is it suppose to have something in it to test what we write?

still broken.  tried on firefox, chrome, IE.  Also reported the bug before I knew it had already been reported.

Any luck on a solution ?

no, given i said:

and will inform of any updates


and i haven’t given updates

facing the same issue, is this resolve?

313,Learn ReactJS - The ternary operator 11/16 why the inverted commas?,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
Hi all
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/react-jsx-advanced/exercises/jsx-conditionals-ternary?action=lesson_resume&link_content_target=interstitial_undefined
my code doesn’t behave incorrectly. My question is in code below, why are kitty and doggy in inverted commas, this does not seem to follow the logic as they are constant names not strings.


coinToss() == ‘heads’ ? ‘kitty’ : ‘doggy’



","
lets simplify the code a little bit:
pics['kitty']

kitty is a string here, given we use it as key to get value from pics dictionary
the kitty and doggy are variables within the dictionary, yes, but these variable have a very limited scope (inside the dictionary), the key has to be a string, it can be a variable but then you get:
const kitty = 'kitty'

now we can use kitty variable as key to retrieve value from dictionary

Now I see it. Thanks

314,Terrible First Impression,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
I have taken courses on this site long ago, and my biggest frustration has always been when you know for certain you did what you were told and there is still an error. I came back to take the React course, and low and behold the very first lesson is broken. It says simply, past this code into app.js and hit run:
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

So the logical next step would be to paste the code in, and hit run. But when I do it loads, then gives me a red X by that instruction. There are no spaces, I am in the right file, I have restarted my coarse progress, reset the file, and reloaded the site. I have checked everything I can think of. Anyone know of anything else I could be doing wrong? Or is just broken?
I have a vid but new users can’t upload attachments.

I’m having this issue with every step now. Even when I get code, nothing changes. I just have to submit 3 times and select ‘Get Code’ to move on.

I’m having a similar issue as textpro20206.
Anything I submit just says it’s incorrect, but does not give feedback as to why.
I keep submitting it until it finally gives me the option to get the code.
I’ve copied and pasted before and after getting the code and they appear to be the same.

I am experiencing this as well. I have been able to verify that the code from the show me the correct code is properly populating by resetting one of the lessons and submitting until I get the prompt. I hope they fix this soon or that this section is the only one that is broken like this.

I had same issues since yesterday. I’ve checked my code which is exactly correct. So annoying.

322,When to use/not use .bind() for a class method in React?,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
In this exercise (“Call this.setState from Another Function”), the code provided includes the following: this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this);The lesson texts states:

This line is necessary because makeSomeFog()'s body contains the word this.

HOWEVER, in other React components, there are class methods that contain this, and yet, their class constructor() DOES NOT contain the special binding call for those functions.  One example is the “Random Color Picker” project, where the class contains several methods that use this in their body (ex.: componentDidMount(), isLight() and applyColor()).  None of these methods are bound in the constructor().Can someone please explain why, despite containing this, these other class methods do not need to be bound in the class constructor()?  The explanation/rule provided in the lesson is not actually followed in these cases, which is making this subject very confusing…Thanks!

324,False/Misleading Information,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
This page shows information that I believe to be incorrect:

In regular JavaScript, style names are written in hyphenated-lowercase:
const styles = {
  'margin-top':       ""20px"",
  'background-color': ""green""
};

In React, those same names are instead written in camelCase:
const styles = {
  marginTop:       ""20px"",
  backgroundColor: ""green""
};


In vanilla JavaScript, the shown method is pretty much useless. It cannot be used with el.setAttribute('style', styles) because it’s an object and not a string, and even a roundabout solution with JSON.stringify() would require removing the curly brackets. Also, the element’s style attribute (el.style) is read-only, and so el.style = styles will fail. Moreover, the idiomatic way to set styles for an element with vanilla JavaScript is el.style.backgroundColor = 'red', which uses camelCase. The description on this page is misleading at best, and should be updated to avoid confusion.
","
https://zhenyong.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html

In React, inline styles are not specified as a string. Instead they are specified with an object whose key is the camelCased version of the style name, and whose value is the style’s value, usually a string

Inside of the function changeColor assign the entire ternary conditional to a new variable const newColor
you currently have it set to this.state

changeColor() {
    const newColor = this.state.color == green ? {color: yellow}: {color: green};
  }


You want to be able to use this.setState to update the value of the current state of Toggle
On a new line within the function changeColor update the state so it includes newColor
this.setState = ({myStateNameIs: myUpdatedStateValueIs});

327,Separate Container Components From Presentational Components: Apply,"FAQ,React.js",,6,"
I dont understand how the following code is getting called and how it works ! ?
What is interval doing here and what do these below methods do ?
how are they invoked here in this code ?


componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }



","
Lifecycle methods are methods that get called at certain moments in a component’s life.
There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting
There are three mounting lifecycle methods
componentWillMount
render
componentDidMount
When a component mounts:
ReactDOM.render(
  <element />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

it automatically calls these three methods, in order
ReactJS is handling this methods call when you mount a component, you can use this to your advantage when designing your app.
Impossible to say what exactly interval is without knowing where the example is coming from
componentDidMount is called when a component is rendered for the first time, so this is a good place to start an interval (to start an update cycle to update the element every 5 seconds)
then when the component is removed, componentWillUnmount is called, you clear the interval

The code comes from this example. :
import React from ‘react’;
import ReactDOM from ‘react-dom’;
import {GuineaPigs} from ‘…/components/GuineaPigs’;
const GUINEAPATHS = [
https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-1.jpg’,
‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-2.jpg’,
];
class GuineaPigsContainer extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = { currentGP: 0 };

this.interval = null;

this.nextGP = this.nextGP.bind(this);

}
nextGP() {
let current = this.state.currentGP;
let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
this.setState({ currentGP: next });
}
componentDidMount() {
this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
}
componentWillUnmount() {
clearInterval(this.interval);
}
render() {
let src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP];
return ;
}
}
ReactDOM.render(
<GuineaPigsContainer />,
document.getElementById(‘app’)
);

do you still have questions left after my explanation? The interval in this case, is to display a new picture every 5 seconds

Thank you for the detailed explanation of components lifecycle methods.

328,5/7 Why use const?,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
Inside the toggleMood method, a variable is set to a ternary operator:
const newMood = this.state.mood == 'good' ? 'bad' : 'good';

But I thought this variable cannot be changed or re-declared, so when it toggles moods, how does this work? Why not use var? Just wondering!
Thanks.

A const cannot be updated or removed, that is correct. But if the object is a data structure (Object, Array) that object can be updated.
const my_obj = {};
const my_array = [];

The type cannot be changed or reassigned, but the objects themselves are completely mutable.
As we can see above, state is an object, not a value.

Yes we cannot change the data type that has been assigned to the const
my_obj = {}
but we are allowed to update the contents of the object
my_obj = {age: 25}
or even
my_obj.name = ""tommy"";
console.log(my_obj);
//{age: 25, name: ""tommy""}

Exercise 8/15, “Nested JSX” provides the following instructions:

So, we want to select another option from the drop-down menu for that option to be written on top of the page. In Parent.js, we call the Child component within render() function. And in Child.js, we need to create an event listener so that the changes will take effect. And eventually, a child component will change the state of its parent component. BUT, in Child.js, why do we need to write this line:
{this.props.onChange}

Why can’t I write {this.props.changeName} so that it can invoke changeName()? What’s the value of {this.props.onChange} or how does the rest of the chain reaction continue?

You don’t have to, but the the indent makes the code much more readable, it would be foolish to not properly indent your code
if i was given a project with 10,000 lines of code with no indent at all, i would walk away at that very moment
Indent makes the code more readable, and easier to understand

Yeah, I understand that it is for styling and readability purpose. But when I was trying to do this exercise, missing the space after “if” resulted in an error message, so I was just wondering if we need it for syntax. Thanks!

// Normal way to display a prop:
export class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>;
  }
}

// Stateless functional component way to display a prop:
export const MyComponentClass = (props) => {
  return <h1>{props.title}</h1>;
}

// Normal way to display a prop using a variable:
export class MyComponentClass extends React.component {
  render() {
    let title = this.props.title;
    return <h1>{title}</h1>;
  }
}

// Stateless functional component way to display a prop using a variable:
export const MyComponentClass = (props) => {
  let title = props.title;
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}


The above shows two functional components. How does it compare to your code?

So the challenge begins with

Select GuineaPigs.js.
You can see your GuineaPigs stateless functional component from earlier.

My confusion was that I wasnt seeing a stateless functional component… therefore I needed someone else to see if they experienced the same thing…
it might just be me on my end, i probably never turned it into a stateless function before!

I haven’t pursued Reactjs since completing the module when it first went up last year. Actually pretty dumb when it comes to helping others, so I should have stayed mum. Can we see your code from GuineaPigs.js?

I passed that challenge but i didnt know if it was something i murked myself or browser cache or otherwise 

Would still like to compare your code to mine, if you don’t mind. Wrap it in a spoiler tag so it cannot be copied.

yeah @mtf see, Im back on the referenced challenge here
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-102/lessons/stateless-functional-components/exercises/stateless-functional-component-props?action=lesson_resume
and the step is green but this is in the editor
import React from 'react';

export class GuineaPigs extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let src = this.props.src;
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

it needs to be rewritten as a functional component
also resetting the challenge doesnt revert the step (it continues to be green so thats a bit confusing!)
and so here is how I rewrote it

import React from 'react';

export const GuineaPigs = (props) => {
let src = props.src;
   return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
}



Have you figured out what is meant by stateless?

yeah it is components without state, and they are essentially just plain functions




 tommygebru:

they are essentially just plain functions


More precisely, ‘pure’ functions since they do not interact with the outer scope. Something in, something out, and always predictible. At least that’s how I see it.

Hey Dominic,
I was having this exact same problem and it was driving me crazy. I used this guide to come up with the following code that now (after many hours of hair-pulling) renders correctly in my browser:
//App.js

var React = require('react');

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Testing, testing. 1 2 3.</h1>;
    }
}

module.exports = App;

It seems the only difference from your code is in the first line, where I used var React = require('react') rather than import React from 'react'.
I hope the wonderful folks at Codecademy update the tutorial with some working code, or at least explain that what we’re expected to write isn’t quite what we’d learned in the previous tutorials.
Anyways, hope this helps. Good luck!

Ahhh nice one! I haven’t given this a try yet but will hopefully get around to it on Monday! I will let you know what this yelds. Hopefully Codecademy do update this tutorial in just this area!

Hey buddy I just wanted to say that the last bit at the end is essentially saying “when in doubt use them” because it couldn’t hurt to organize your lists

This is a response/answer to a recently closed post
Hey @nature88 are you still working through React.js Part 1 ?
Following the tutorial in the link you shared, the part that is JSX is the code that looks like HTML
Like so
<li key={""person_"" + i}>{person}</li> and <ul>{peopleLis}</ul>
However in the code you shared, we have the map method on a string with an output that is resulting in errors because you used an ES6 feature called template strings, as shown in the second blockquote.
Therefore there is no JSX in there and it shall be interpreted as a string
While JSX is being transpiled by Babel, in order to make calls in React like React.createElement()

Below makes sense to me - because an array of strings would appear – however not including quotes as in the example above - does not>:
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];

const listItems = strings.map(string => `<li>${string}</li>`);

console.log(listItems);

if statements and for loops are not expressions in JavaScript, so they can’t be used in JSX directly. Instead, you can put these in the surrounding code.
so we can’t use if and for inside a JSX directly (between the {}), however, a ternary operator is an expression so we can use it in JSX

I’m currently having trouble with all exercises in ReactJS Part I. Basically, nothing is rendering at all in the Codecademy browser. I can complete the activities fine, but I can’t see the results of what I’ve done so it makes it a bit difficult to understand the effects of what I’m doing. I’ve tried clearing my cache, clearing my cookies, restarting the browser, and I’ve tried it in both Firefox and Chrome with the same effect.
This is what I see whenever I hit “Run”. Can anyone help me? I’ve checked some of the other courses that have the new UI and they work fine. What’s weird is that sometimes (but not all the time) if I refresh the CA browser over and over the content will eventually appear.

-1 At the beginning of every exercise, a refresh-browser using F5-function-key
-2 then do the exercise
-3 an other refresh-browser
-4 with the mouse position your mouse-pointer AFTER the localhost:8000 and click
-5 as the cursor blinks behind the =8000= then press the ENTER-key.

355,When are Parentheses needed for calling methods?,"FAQ,React.js",,5,"
https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/react-101/lessons/react-components-advanced-jsx/exercises/component-event-listener
In section 5, the lack of parentheses on the .food() method is reasoned by the presence of a “getter” method. However, section 6 does NOT use “get” and yet we still see the .scream() method without parentheses in the code:

{this.scream}


So what is the true reason for not using parentheses here? Or, is scream() somehow a getter method without actually using the “get” keyword?
","
parentheses = ()
accolade/curly brackets = {}
{this.food} was just an example of a getter method, {this.scream} is also a getter method
i mean, simplifying the example:
3 + 2
4 + 3

both cases involves the plus operator, just like  {this.scream} and {this.food} are both getter methods, any value could be used to teach you getter method or plus operator.

stetim94, Thank you for your reply, but perhaps I did not state the issue clearly.
In Section 5, codecademy explains the reason for leaving off parentheses on the .food() method like this:

Why don’t you need parentheses after this.food? Shouldn’t it be this.food()?
You don’t need those parentheses, because .food is a getter method. You can tell this from the get in the above class declaration body.

However, in the next section, Section 6, the scream() method is defined without using the get keyword. If the above definition of a getter method is to be believed, the scream() method is not a getter method unless the get keyword is invoked.
Does that clarify my misunderstanding?

hm… the instructions aren’t very clear about this matter
in React, you define event handlers as methods on a component class. Like this:
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  myFunc() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div onHover={this.myFunc}>
      </div>;
    );
  }
}

event handlers have the same syntax as getters, JS will make the distinguish between getter method and event handlers

359,"Why not mention that ""props"" is short for properties?","FAQ,React.js",,2,"
I thought it was strange that when introducing “props” it never mentioned that it is short for properties.  Then, later in the exercise, there is even this:

A curmudgeonly clarification about grammar:
You may have noticed some loose usage of the words prop and props. Unfortunately, this is pretty inevitable.
props is the name of the object that stores passed-in information. this.props refers to that storage object. At the same time, each piece of passed-in information is called a prop. This means that props could refer to two pieces of passed-in information, or it could refer to the object that stores those pieces of information 

Couldn’t this all be avoided by using “properties” or “property” when referring to “passed-in information”?

Okay, we add this
Button.defaultProps = { text: 'I am a button' };
But why exactly does the Button component take defaultProps as the default source for text?
Is defaultProps a hardcoded default property of all components in React?
","
our button expects a property text:
      <button>
        {this.props.text}
      </button>

defaultProps is a method we can use to give a default property in case no property is provided, in this case use text because button is expecting a property named text

Thanks, I now managed to find out more info on defaultProps in React’s docs:

You can define default values for your props by assigning to the special defaultProps property […] The defaultProps will be used to ensure that this.props.name will have a value if it was not specified by the parent component. The propTypes typechecking happens after defaultProps are resolved, so typechecking will also apply to the defaultProps.

So it is a special property of React components.

Docs are always a good place to find more information about something
yes, defaultProps is a special property/method of react component to set a default property in case no other properties are provided

const is short for contant, which indicates the variable’s value won’t change.

let is the opposite, meaning that the variable’s value will change
and var is just neutral between the two

There is no code yet because the exercise is asking you to write it from scratch.


const is a new keyword in ES6+. Values assigned to it cannot be changed, however, lists and dictionaries can be. Their variable just cannot be reassigned.
const list = []

list.append('I\'m a change to the list')

console.log(list)    // ['I\'m a change to the list']

function fourthMethod(e,id,pattern) {
  if (id == ""#01013"") {
    console.log(id);
    const re = new RegExp(pattern);
   // const re = /[a-fA-F]+/g;
    if (!re.test(e.key)) {
      e.preventDefault();
    }
  }

  }

My index.js where I am rendering text input component is given below:
const TextInputComponent = require('../../components/TextInput')
const TextInput = ({ fieldName, placeholder, style, id, tabIndex, pattern }) => {

    return (

        <TextInputComponent pattern={pattern} id={id} tabIndex={tabIndex} onBlur={fieldChanged} fieldName={fieldName}
         placeholder={placeholder} style={style} ></TextInputComponent>

    )
  }

Now I need for this text input component which will show if I enter a digit to the text field. How can I achieve it ?

looking at step 5 of the instructions:

you placed divStyle at the wrong place, it shouldn’t be part of Home component.

<PLEASE USE THIS TEMPLATE TO HELP YOU CREATE A GREAT POST!>
Currently I am stuck here. I do not know how the code works since as I know, if ReactDOM.render() works, it will only render the guineapigs and only the render part of guineapigs will be executed. At the render of guinea pigs, there is only src which is GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP]. It did not call any function at all (nextGP(), componentDidMount(), componentWillUnmount()). SO how these function executed while it is not in the rendered side.

376,4.1/5 Make the attribute's value equal to the function that you passed in from Parent.js,"FAQ,React.js",,4,"
Instructions read:

Make the attribute’s value equal to the function that you passed in from Parent.js. If you can’t remember what prop name you used, then check Parent’s render function.

I can’t understand what to write in order to equal the function that I passed in from Parent.js on the previous exercise.
I’ve tried thinking about how the option value will change the name. I just can’t figure it out. Can anyone explain?
As of right now I have:
onChange={this.changeName}

import React from 'react';

export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>

  }

Try to change that bit to onChange={this.props.onChange}
If I understood it right you have to pass the props name and not the value to the child. If the prop in Parent component is name onChange and value is function name, which is changeName, then to call the function from Child component you have to call like this: onChange={this.props.onChange}.
Sorry if it is still not clear. It’s bit fuzzy for myself as well, but this solution worked for now.

I’m stuck at step 2, for adding the onClick attribute. In the preview, it works, but when I click RUN I get an error message:
“The  should have an attribute of onClick={makeDoggy}.”
Is it sensitive where the attribute is placed inside the <img> tag, or something else I’m missing?
I’m on Firefox 53 and OSX 10.12.5

```
var React = require(‘react’);
var ReactDOM = require(‘react-dom’);
function makeDoggy (e) {
// Call this extremely useful function on an .
// The  will become a picture of a doggy.
e.target.setAttribute(‘src’, ‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg’);
e.target.setAttribute(‘alt’, ‘doggy’);
}
var kitty = (

);
ReactDOM.render(kitty, document.getElementById(‘app’));
<do not remove the three backticks above>
","
UPDATE
After several attempts more, was able to get the “Stuck?” modal popup, and used “Get the Code”. Below is the difference.
It seems key to place the onClick at the end of the <img> tag. Is this required generally in JSX or best practices?
“Get the Code” final copy and pasted below
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

function makeDoggy (e) {
  // Call this extremely useful function on an <img>.
  // The <img> will become a picture of a doggy.
  e.target.setAttribute('src', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg');
  e.target.setAttribute('alt', 'doggy');
}

var kitty = (
	<img 
		src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg"" 
		alt=""kitty"" 
    onClick={makeDoggy} />
);

ReactDOM.render(kitty, document.getElementById('app'));


UPDATE 2
I believe I found the error. The checker is VERY sensitive about having a space after the <img> tag vs a return line.
For example, the original code below will not work:
var kitty = (
	<img
		onClick={makeDoggy}
		src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg"" 
		alt=""kitty"" />
);

But adding a space after the <img> tag before the line return marks step 2 as completed
var kitty = (
	<img 
		onClick={makeDoggy}
		src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg"" 
		alt=""kitty"" />
);

You can see the added space if you click-drag to highlight the added space after the <img> tag but before the line return for onClick

do you need help    with a question

I think @jpostdesign already solved his problem.

This is easy! The workspace is pretty clear on this, announcing:
ReactDOM.render's first argument should be <h1>{theBestString}</h1>.
But your first argument for ReactDOM.render() is greeting because you unnecessarily put it in an additional var.
This is okay in reality, but the workspace seems to check the first argument passed to ReactDOM.render().

Ah right, didn’t realise you could put html tags directly in as an argument, thought they had to be put into a var first judging from the example on the page that does just that.
Thanks for the help!

391,12 : run problem,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
Hello,
I add a problem with exercise 12: whatever I write it runs infinitely and never says if it is OK or not… so you can’t unlock the next lesson.
I couldn’t find the solution on this forum, but I finally find how to do and write it here to help people who has the same problem.
I deleted the content of .js and .html - so it is clearly wrong but there is no loop. You do it 3 times and then, a help appear to ask you if you want to continue or get code - so get code and you have the correct answer and unlock the next lesson.
It is probably not the perfect solution, but it unlock the next lessons…

392,React Part 2 Container Components,"FAQ,React.js",,2,"
This code works… What I don’t understand is how is the interval getting set?
I see that in the GuineaPigsContainer class we have a property called componentDidMount which is a function definition that calls setInterval(). We also have a property called componentWillUnmount which clears the interval. The interval property seems to be initialized, as the carousel is working, but I don’t see any call to componentDidMount()?
Can someone explain why this is working? componentDidMount is not a self invoking function? And if it is just called anyway, why isn’t componentWillUnmount? Is it a special property name like getInitialState? Where is a list of these ‘special’ property names?

<Below this line, in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
As some of you may know on exercise 3 of this series,  the below code does not work when you use friends[1] for your “friend” variable.

```
{friend.title}
<do not remove the three backticks above>
One possible solution is to use a different friend from the array, but I was curious what was wrong with friends[1]. For some reason, the double space between two of the words in the string seems to be what was breaking it. Remove one of the spaces, and it works. I'm not sure _why_ the double space is causing the issue, but it is. So, remove the second space between ""Hey Guys!"" and ""Wait Up!"" in the title for friends[1].
","
once you taken the exercises, it isn’t re-validated, so the only thing i can look at is the output:

edb5dfd1827aef0470c1a1f218df3fae4dc86126.png1346×579

which is fine with friends[1]

Hmm, I’m not sure if you can reset the workspace to reset the validation, but that might be a way to try it out. Either way, I’m assuming it has to do with a regex or whatever parser is being used to look for code errors in the editor. The regex is probably looking for exactly one space between words.

<Below this line, in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
I’m at the end of this lesson  and my code works, but I don’t understand it. I understand that Parent inherits Child and Siblings’ props to update it’s state, but usually this is passed through a variable called “name”. “name” is collected through the  element’s onChange attribute, where the event is captured from the 's value attribute. From there, it’s passed into changeName, and there’s the newName argument, but it’s never referenced anywhere else. Does React understand “new” as a prefix or am I not understanding something? I know arguments can be named anything, but usually they’re named to relate to a global variable like “name” is.
Why does newName work?

```
var Parent = React.createClass({
// getInitialState function
changeName: function (newName) {
this.setState({
name: newName
});

If it is truly stuck you may just have to do that…

<Below this line, in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
Here is something that frustrates me about the example given. If.js is as follows:
if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  var message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  var message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}

This makes it seem as if JSX elements can be used inside conditionals, as long as you end add “;” to the closing parenthesis.
The code below is the code the project provides in app.js along with my answer:



var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

function coinToss () {
  // This function will randomly return either 'heads' or 'tails'.
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';
}

var pics = {
  kitty: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};

// if/else statement begins here:
if (coinToss() == 'heads') {
  var img = (
    <img src={pics.kitty} />;
  );
} else{
  var img = (
    <img src={pics.doggy} />;
    );
}

ReactDOM.render(img,
                document.getElementById('app')


);



Why is it that when I create a JSX element around image tags, the compiler throws an error? It’s laid out exactly the same way as the example but using <img /> instead of <h1> </h1>.
Am I just missing something? The syntax matches all other lessons (and the example) exactly from what I can tell.
","
These lines are the problems:
var img = (
    <img src={pics.kitty} />;
  );

And:
var img = (
    <img src={pics.doggy} />;
    );

You don’t need to end your <img /> tags with semicolons as that’s handled after your closing brackets at the end of the lines. In a way, the parentheses sort of extend your line.
If you were doing the code like this:
var img = <img src={pics.kitty} />;

Then you would need the semicolon as it’s the end of the line.
Your code is basically the same as doing this:
var img = ( <img src={pics.kitty} /> );

As you can see, the semicolon is at the end of the line.
If this helped, please mark this answer as the solution. Thanks 

Ah I see!!
That’s fantastic, thank you! I was racking my brain trying to figure out what I was missing lol. Appreciate your time

This has been an issue for as long as I can remember. I’m pretty sure it’s all due to how the courses are created. For now, I suggest this one easy tip: Just copy and paste the text it asks you to type.

I concur completely with this suggestion.
Creativity should always be encouraged, rather than a simple copy and paste of the recommended text.

Exactly my point, learning by tinkering and trying out your own things! not just kind of mindless copy/paste…

Simple fix! You just need a space between {goose} and the forward-slash (/)

i just tried, but doesnt work

Try it again, but replace the variable with this:
( <img src={goose} /> );
Or put your own code all on one line, and it might make it easier to spot a bug.

nope, even that edit doesnt work

Try removing the parentheses when you define gooseImg.

//ProfilePage.js//

var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
var NavBar = require('./NavBar');

var ProfilePage = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <NavBar />
        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
        <p>I like movies and blah blah blah blah blah</p>
        <img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-monkeyselfie.jpg"" />
      </div>
    );
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(<ProfilePage />, document.getElementById(""app""));

//NavBar.js //

var React = require('react');

var NavBar = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    var pages = ['home', 'blog', 'pics', 'bio', 'art', 'shop', 'about', 'contact'];
    var navLinks = pages.map(function(page){

I am not sure how to create the .babelrc configuration file. I am using windows, and I am not sure what root directory means. Also, if I create the file with notepad, it only saves as a .txt. Notepad ++ does not have the .babelrc extension. Can I do this all from the command line?

```
<do not remove the three backticks above>
","
.babelrc is the full filename. There’s no file-extension and np++ is unlikely to enforce a file extension. If it does, rename the file after creating it.
The root of a tree is the parent of all nodes, so it’s the top-most directory. In the context of a project that is the directory containing the project.

I’m currently on step 2 of this exercise. I wrote code to render the ‘kitty’ picture, but the image took an hour to render. Now that the image is loaded, I’m trying to test my code (the makeDoggy function), but all I’m seeing are the cat picture and loading icons (in the green box at the bottom and at the top right corner). I’ve been waiting for about 20 minutes now. This seems a bit excessive. I’m living in South Korea and using a South Korean internet connection, so I don’t think that’s the problem. Is there something wrong with the way I’ve written my code? Surely this isn’t normal.
EDIT: The exercise finally worked as it should a couple minutes after I made this topic, though I did nothing to intervene. Still, is there some mistake I made in my code that caused this exercise to take an hour and a half in loading time?

```
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
function makeDoggy (e) {
// Call this extremely useful function on an .
// The  will become a picture of a doggy.
e.target.setAttribute(‘src’, ‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg’);
e.target.setAttribute(‘alt’, ‘doggy’);
}
var kitty = (

react_photo-kitty.jpg3264×2448

ReactDOM.render(kitty, document.getElementById(‘app’));

Move TopNumber.js to its original place. It should be in files.

topNumber.js doesn’t appear in the files

please at  least provide the exact code of topNumber so that it can be recreated it

some problem with you

I am seeing the same issue.  Tried cache clear, logging back in, exercise reset, Topnumber.js still missing.  Looks like perhaps also the code itself in the other files becomes corrupted.

Please fix this! I have the same issue, TopNumber.js just went and is nowhere to be found. Instead, Headline.js is showing up in the tabs.

Is this probem solved? I have the same, TopNumber.js is missing or moved. pls advice

Buuuump.  This whole exercise 2,3 and also 4 is buggy.   The site wants u to sign up for pro.  No way in ■■■■ if non pro is this buggy

When it stays this buggy I will not sign up up for pro. In the mean time I donn’t make anny progress, is their nobody who got passed this chapter and can help out?

I have got the exact same issue. It just won’t give me the standard “Top Number.js” file. I also tried to clear my Cache, relogging and restarting my browser.

Hello guys.
This is a working version of TopNumber.js - just copy paste it and it will allow you to move to the next course.
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
var yellow = 'rgb(255, 215, 18)';

var TopNumber = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    number: React.PropTypes.number,
    game: React.PropTypes.bool
  },

  getInitialState: function () {
    return { 'highest': 0 };
  },

   componentWillReceiveProps: function (nextProps) {
      if (nextProps.number > this.state.highest) {
    this.setState({
      'highest' : nextProps.number
    });
      }
},
  
  
  render: function () {
    return (
      <h1>
        Top Number: {this.state.highest}
      </h1>
    );
  }
});

module.exports = TopNumber;


This ReactJS course is amazing, even with this minor bug / annoyance.

@chiprunner79610 thanks for this code can you please post the working code for Target.js for the next exercise

Hello Objectrunner40997.
This is Target.js in “3 / 7 shouldComponentUpdate” - please note that I did not find any bugs / problems in step 3 / 7.
var React = require('react');
var random = require('./helpers').random;

var Target = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    number: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
  },
  
  shouldComponentUpdate : function (nextProps, nextState) {
    return this.props.number != nextProps.number;
  },

  render: function () {
    var visibility = this.props.number
      ? 'visible' : 'hidden';
    var style = {
      position: 'absolute',
      left: random(100) + '%',
      top:  random(100) + '%',
      fontSize: 40,
      cursor: 'pointer',
      visibility: visibility
    };

    return (
      <span 
        style={style} 
        className=""target"" >
        {this.props.number}
      </span>
    )
  }
});

module.exports = Target;


I cannot find the target.js in my files and i had tried many times to create it with the code but it doesn’t work even your code doesn’t working i don’t know what’s the problem with this exercise

Is there any way to reset the exercise in 3/7 when i am trying to reset the exercise it says workspace not restored. Please any help with this. Thanks in advance

Thanks a lot, chiprunner79610! Pasting in your code ‘fixed’ it for me, i.e. allowed me to continue with the course. Wasn’t able to reset or restore TopNumber.js either.

Yes it’s a bug. I’ve already made a bug report. I hope they will fix it soon.

so there is no option to skip this lesson and move next?

Keep clicking run until it asks you if you want to get code.

Same problem. Can’t report a bug either

Hi, folks.  I’ve seen this mentioned in some older posts, but I haven’t seen a solution, or an indication that this has been solved, but the second exercise on componentWillUpdate, I added the code but got a syntax error.  Couldn’t find said syntax error, so I ended up copying and pasting the code in the exercise listing, and got the same syntax error.
It gets weirder.  I got the “Having trouble” prompt, but it would not let me click the “Get Code”, however the “No, thanks” worked just fine.  Finally, after multiple tries, I attempted to reset the exercise, whereupon I was promptly disconnected from the server.  Further tries have shaped up the same way.
So, does anybody know a workaround?  Or is this one of the magic bugs that keep popping up?
Edit: attaching the code, since I finally got it to come up without freezing.  I tried a couple of edits in an attempt to remove ambiguity, but they have accomplished nothing yet.
var React = require(‘react’);

Are you meant to be returning a string here?

yep, friends has string properties:

problem was here:

I changed index to 0 and 2 and passed the lesson, but when index I got error: Friend’s’ <h1></h1> should contain {friend.title}. Looks like a bug?

This has been brought up before. There may be a bug report on it that has not yet been reviewed. Glad you took the initiative to try other indexes. That is what others have done, as well, with the same success.

437,Why quotes and square brackets with the ternary conditional operator?,"FAQ,React.js",,6,"
<PLEASE USE THIS TEMPLATE TO HELP YOU CREATE A GREAT POST!>
Can someone explain the use of the quotes and the square brackets in the ternary operator in the below piece of code from the exercise at the link? The square brackets are similar to calling an object’s property, I guess. But I cannot understand why the values of the object have to be taken into the quotes…

};
var img = <img src={pics[coinToss() == ‘heads’ ? ‘kitty’ : ‘doggy’]} />;
<do not remove the three backticks above>
","
Hi,
The property of an object can be accessed in two ways.
 objectName.propertyName

objectName[""propertyName""]


So in the above example, if coinToss() == 'heads' is true, then var img = <img src={pics['kitty']} />;
or if coinToss() == 'heads'  is false then var img = <img src={pics['doggy']} />;

Hi, thanks for the reply.
I thought you need quotes only when you set a property, but then, if you get it with brackets,  you need no quotes, like so:
1. var object = {};
2. object['1'] = 'value';
3. console.log(object[1]);


that’s why I got a bit confused (still confused).

Hi,
In order to both set and get properties of an object , you need quotes if you are using bracket notation. You can read about it here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects

Thank you very much for taking the time to reply once again. I have learned a little bit more through this. Going further with learning now. See you!

440,React. problem with understanding function makeDoggy,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
Hello guys,
I don’t understand this piece of code.
Can you help me?
What does function makeDoggy mean.How did it work.I click on image and get another picture.
P.s (sry for my english)
var React = require(‘react’);
var ReactDOM = require(‘react-dom’);
function makeDoggy (e) {
// Call this extremely useful function on an .
// The  will become a picture of a doggy.
e.target.setAttribute(‘src’, ‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg’);
e.target.setAttribute(‘alt’, ‘doggy’);
}
var kitty = (

);
ReactDOM.render(kitty, document.getElementById(‘app’));
","
When the img is clicked, makeDoggy takes that event of the click and gets the target (The img tag is the target since is what had the onClick handler and is what was clicked on) . It takes the img and sets it’s src attribute to the new image link (changing the image I assume) and then it changes the alt attribute of the image tag. The first two lines of this code are just importing the React and ReactDOM packages.
Hope that helps  .

QUESTION I NEED HELP WITH:
I’m assuming that I have punctuation errors (particularly in App.js ? ).  Does anyone have help to get this application running?  If so, it would be mighty appreciated!
","
You haven’t installed webpack, among a few others

Hello @ionatan!  Thanks for your help, so far!
I re-installed the webpack, re-configured the HTML WebPackPlugin & babel, too.  After that the program was able to run, thankfully.
However, when I open the App’s URL now : http://localhost:8080 , the page displayed is completely blank and white.  LINK TO INSTRUCTIONS <-- Scroll down to the Sub-Heading “Run A Local React App”.
Below is the code that is supposed to run on it:
CODE : app/components/App.js
var React = require('react');

var MyComponentClass = React.createClass ({
	render: function () {
		return (
			<h1>Hello world</h1>
		);
	}
});

module.exports = MyComponentClass;

QUESTION:
I believe that there are punctuation errors, but am unable to locate them.  Are you able to assist?  In addition, the remaining code in the other related files, are in the OP for your reference.

A white page suggests a page was served. Check the source of the page

@ionatan
Thanks again!   The source code from the white web page shows this:
index.html :
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">

<head>
	<meta charset=""UTF-8"">
	<title>My First Local App</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div id=""app""></div>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""transformed.js""></script></body>
</html>

When I modify the component class’ render function in App.js (please see the above OP for code), nothing shows up on the white page.  Any thoughts / ideas on why this may be happening?
The only way I can get something to show up on the page is by including HTML in index.html such as :  <h1> MyComponentClass </h1> between the two “div” brackets.




 snaylz:

<MyCompnentClass />,


Aside from that, they name it App.
I don’t know what’s up or down in a react app though.
Would be nice with some logging on the requests, but yeah, no clue how to make that happen.

I got some logging out of setting DEBUG=’*’
DEBUG='*' npm run start

Lots of output but nothing about my intentional typo that I could see. I don’t really know what to expect or how those things are “supposed” to be debugged though.
Anyway, correcting that typo should make the app render and show up, like you already found out by replacing it by just <h1>blah blah</h1>

@ionatan Wohoo!  That solved the problem.

RESOLVED!  For some reason the error was being triggered by a different area:
Here’s the correction…
BEFORE:
componentWillUpdate: function (nextProps, nextState) {
    if (document.body.style.background != yellow && this.state.highest > 950*1000) {
      document.body.style.background = yellow;
    } else if (!this.props.game && nextProps.game) {
  document.body.style.background = 'white';
   }
},

AFTER:
componentWillUpdate: function (nextProps, nextState) {
    if (document.body.style.background != yellow && this.state.highest >= 950000) {
      document.body.style.background = yellow;
    } else if (!this.props.game && nextProps.game) {
  document.body.style.background = 'white';
   }
},

SEE: Second line of code for the difference.

A previous user said clearing cookies was a good idea. Ctrl + F5 hard refreshes and that seemed to be what made it work for me.

Hi, I got the same problems a few times. I don’t know why but this worked for me:

Go to the home page https://www.codecademy.com/learn

Click the course in the list on the left side
In the Syllabus section, click a lesson that you have not started yet
Choose Resume to go to the exercise where you got stuck, and now the same code works.

Finally, hope the issue get fixed soon.

Found the answer!
I had a double ""}""after “styles” which was unnecessary.
BEFORE (incorrect):
var styleMe = <h1 style={styles}}>Please style me!  I am so bland!</h1>;

AFTER (correct):
var styleMe = <h1 style={styles}>Please style me!  I am so bland!</h1>;

Hello
I experience an error message when attempting npm run build in React Setup, Part V: Conclusion. I have attempted to figure out the error for a while now with no luck. Perhaps I am missing something.
This is the error message:

This is a similar message as another poster, but the solution did not work for me.
This is the code in index.js, .babelrc and webpack.config.js:
If I need to show additional files, please let me know. Thanks in advance!

I cannot figure ot, what the problem is with my code…
It is just loading and loading and doesn’t let me move on.



Replace this line with your code. 

var profile = (
  <div>
    <h1>I AM JENKINS</h1>
    <img src=""images/jenkins.png""/>
    <article>
      I LIKE TO SIT
      <br JENKINS IS MY NAME />;
      THANKS A LOT
    </article>
  </div>
);

I've also tried this below but nothing happens just lading and loading endlessly

var profile = (
  <div>
    <h1>I AM JENKINS</h1>
    <img src=""images/jenkins.png"" />
    <article>
      I LIKE TO SIT
      <br JENKINS IS MY NAME />
      <br THANKS HA LOT />
    </article>
  </div>
);

","
What error are you receiving? 

Hey, I think your error might be due to the <br> tags.
They are used for adding breaks in HTML, but no text can be defined between them.
Have you tried using <p></p> to add your text in between?

When I click on the “Run”, it starts loading endlessly and nothing happens.
I have also tried this code below and many others but the same thing happens, it starts loading.
var profile = (

I AM JENKINS

    
      I LIKE TO SIT
      
      JENKINS IS MY NAME
      
      THANKS HA LOT
    
  
);
        
Sorry, it seems I couldn’t paste the whole code.

Hey, After your advice I tried to write the text ‘JENKINS IS MY NAME’ between two full b tags, but the result is the same, after clicking ‘Run’ neverending loading. Where exactly do you mean to use the p ?

You could use the paragraph tags to put the text in, but I see it isn’t needed for this exercise.
You just need to make sure you have no text in your break <br/> tags and no semi-colon after your <br/>
    <article>
         TEXT
             <br />
         TEXT
             <br />
         TEXT
   </article>

If you fix that, it should be able to render. 

Thank you for your help. However, I still have bad news 
After your first reply, I used b tags the way you advised then and now but it still does not let me move on, after clicking ‘Run’ it starts loading 
I had removed the semi-colon earlier 

Have you refreshed the page already and then clicked run again?
Sometimes that helps also. I had that a few times when doing the REACT course. 

I have refreshed the page, tried Chrome, Firefoy but this is the same  …
Loading endlessly.
Thank you very much for your help 

You’re welcome, but I feel bad that it keeps loading for you.
You should have it right now so it should let you pass.
Maybe it’s a bug and you could report it.

I really appreciate your kindness  I have already reported it as a bug.

449,12. JSX Conditionals: &&,"FAQ,React.js",,3,"
Can someone explain to me the logic behind this code. Thanks!.

var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

// judgmental will be true half the time.
var judgmental = Math.random() < 0.5;

var favoriteFoods = (
  <div>
    <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi Burrito</li>
      <li>Rhubarb Pie</li>
      {!judgmental && <li>Nacho Cheez Straight Out The Jar</li>}
      <li>Broiled Grapefruit</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(
	favoriteFoods, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);

Hi,
When we use Math.random(), it will generate some random number between 0 and 1.
Suppose when you run your program first time, it may generate 0.3, which is less than 0.5. So
var judgemental = true

and
!judgemental = false

While using && operator if one of the condition becomes false, then the whole condition results as false. So the list
<li>Nacho Cheez Straight Out The Jar</li>

does not get rendered along with other list items.
If you run your code again and again Math.random() will generate different numbers , if the number is > 0.5, value of var judgemental becomes false. If number is < 0.5, value of var judgemental becomes true.
Hope this helps.
