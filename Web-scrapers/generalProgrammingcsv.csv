A post was split to a new topic: What Language Should I Start if I Wish to Become a Robotic Engineer?

Hello, I’d like to know where could I code in Python outside of codeacademy for personal purposes? Thank You.

hi i am really sorry actually i am totally new to coding and programing so i wanted help with where to start

Hello, I have a general programming question --> I am currently doing the computer science track course and am on the section regarding pipenv. They mention using a text editor that shows both the filesystem and the terminal - please could you let me know what text editor they are using?
Thanks

Use  VSCode from microsoft. not visual studio though. vscode is free

1,Get your website together | Typing code on your computer,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
In this post I will explain to you how to put together HTML, CSS and other languages you may want to make your website in.
We write code on our computers using a text editor or an IDE. You may read this article written by Codecademy: Where to write your code when you’re not on Codecademy
  You may type out your code on any text editor, for example:

Notepad++
Sublime text
Brackets


You will need to save each language file with its respective extension,
HTML - .html
CSS - .css
JavaScript - .js
Python - .py
Ruby - .rb
Just to mention a few
Save your main page as index.html so it gets indexed as main page (home page)

 Linking languages together - I’m sure you remember <link> ? We use it to link CSS to HTML.  For example:
<link type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheet.css"">

*Remember this goes in the <head> </head> tags
Click for a refresher.
With JavaScript you use script tags:
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""script.js""></script>


Once we have typed out our code, linked it and saved it, we are ready to run it in our browser to test. Make sure your files are in one folder then right click on your HTML file and select - open with - choose your browser.
 Yahooo its working !
Feel like making it live ? Then read Get your Website online

Creating a JavaScript / jQuery file 
File extension for JavaScript is .js
jQuery is the same -(jQuery is a JS library)
There’s two ways of doing this:

Embedding JS in HTML
Creating a JS file and linking to your HTML
*For jQuery don’t forget to link in the jQuery library and jQuery UI (if needed)



Embedding JS in your HTML means to have your JS in your HTML file. How you do this ? In a normal HTML document preferably at the bottom of the HTML file before the closing </body> You add in your JS. Like so:
<script type=""text/javascript"">

//javascript goes in here

</script>


Linking JS to your HTML is simple, in your <head></head> tags add in <script> tags with URL to JS file. Like so:
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""script.js""></script>
//script will be replaced with your file name

*You link in jQuery the same way as JavaScript

Creating a PHP file & running it on computer 
File extension for PHP is .php
Like HTML you will use index to have it appear as landing page.
PHP is a server side language that requires a server in order for the code to be executed.
Setup a server on your computer:

PHP code goes between <?php and ?>
An example how we can make PHP work:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

<?php 
define(""TEST"", ""Hello, lets work with PHP!"");

$my_name = ""Zainab"";
$fav_color = ""Purple"";
$birth_year = 1920; 

date_default_timezone_set('Etc/GMT+2');
$year = date('Y');

$my_age = ($year - $birth_year);
?>

      <h1> <?php echo TEST;?> </h1>
     <p>My name is: <?php echo $my_name;?> </p>
     <p>My fav color is: <?php echo $fav_color;?> </p>
     <p>My age is: <?php echo $my_age;?> </p>

<!-- we can create HTML tags using PHP but in this example I didn't 
as I wanted to show your'l how we can calculate something and then 
run it in normal HTML tags -->
</body>
</html>

This is the outcome:

I know it looking pretty dull without CSS buy hey it calculated my age (fake age ;))

3,Which course is more suitable for a beginner?,"Get Help,General Programming",,8,"
Between Java and Web development and data schience, which one is more suitable for a beginner?
","
They are all quite different. I think Web dev teaches HTML and CSS, which are good, beginner friendly languages. It also teaches JavaScript, which is different to Java, and JavaScript is also quite beginner friendly. The Data Science course teaches Python (I think), which is very beginner friendly, SQL-which might be useful to know, and R (I think), which isn’t too great for beginners, but if you know Python, then R will be easy(ish) to pick up. As for the Java course-that is a standalone course, which only teaches Java. From what I know, Java isn’t the easiest language to learn, so I might come back to that (if you really wanted to learn it).
I hope this helps!

As a beginner choose a easy language such as C or Python(Depends!)
They create a foundation for learning other languages that you might want to learn 

If you have never coded before, I suggest you start with Code Foundations and Computer Science Career Paths. They will teach you the fundamentals of programming and the typical language structures (conditionals, loops, objects, algorithms) that you will find later.

Yes that is also a great option if you chose code foundations

My standard browser is google chrome and I think that every browser is possible to read html-files, but in my case google chrome cannot read my html-file. Can you tell me why?
Here is my local folder, where I store my index.html file

Of course I have the closing body and html tag at end of the file included,
Can you tell me what could be the reason that I cannot view my html-file?
Thank You

","
What does the german error say? I only read Mahler and Schönberg indications.
Chrome should definitely open html.

The access of the file was denied.
The file under file:///Users/katharinamaier/Documents/codecademy/mask/index.html cannot be read.Probably the file was deleted or displaced/shifted or the file authority prohibit the access.

The index.html file was never deleted or shifted to another place. The access of the file, I never programed the access or declared the access rules. In the visual studio code editor I just created the index.html file. Just one click to create a new file.

Are you on a chromebook?
On quick search I found this:

Check if you are in verified mode of the Chrome OS firmware. To access the local Chromebook files, you must enter developer mode.

@justsql as a side note, browsers are very willing to open bad html files even if you have tags all over the place. This means there’s nothing wrong with your code to cause this to happen.

As I understand a chromebook is a specific kind of lap top, I have a normal iMac, not even a laptop. My firmware is Mac OS. Is that correct how I understood your message?!
In general do I need to register somewhere in order to be able to read my html-files via browser?

Do you get the same or a similar error if you try and open the HTML file with Safari?
The error, ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, would suggest a permissions issue. If Safari also can’t open it, that might confirm that it is a permissions issue. 

In Safari I can open the code, but not to the fullest, some elements are not shown.
Now I can open my index.html file with google chrome, but I have the same problem that some elements are not visible,
I use goole chrome, because I want to find out why some parts are not visible by means of dev tools
The dev tool find that this part of link is not valid

How could it be, that dev tools say there is an error in the link, but the same part of the link opens in the same browser, where is the mistake @toastedpitabread @thepitycoder
First I thought that it has something to do with

Browser configurations  (but I use standard browser)
Wrong link, (but part of links work very well in the browser)
Software, could it be that it is a problem with my software?

If I copy the source and paste it into the browser, then it opens:


Your src attribute isn’t explicitly stating that you want to use https, so instead because your HTML is being served via file://the/path/to/your/file/index.html it’s assuming that you want to retrieve file://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com... which is wrong.
When you’re linking to a resource you’re not hosting you should provide the full URI, including protocol. When you paste the src into your browser and hit Go, it assumes you meant to use HTTP(S) and so it loads correctly.

Thank you @thepitycoder I just put “https:”  in src=“https://ws-eu …” and it worked!

7,How to commit?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hi, sorry for the misleading title.
It seems as though I have a problem with commitment. I love programming, I’ve always loved it since I was a kid, the mere idea of being able to communicate with the machine is fascinating to me. But I can’t seem to be able to continue with a course beyond 70% progress. I start off the course all excited and passionate, but after a while I lose interest and start slacking off, until I eventually stop completely.
Does anyone know any tips or tricks, motivations or ways to keep the interest going? For my C# course I had a motive that I now know was a wrong motive and completely counterproductive, I had a piece of code that was broken and I really wanted it to work, I went ahead with C# course so I can fix it, and once I was able to, I lost interest in C# and didn’t continue with the course.
Any comments, shared stories, tips, thoughts would be appreciated 
Good day.
","
git commit -m ""just do the thing!""
In all seriousness, though, there are two reasons why I’m here to expand my programming knowledge:


I “code” in my job. Granted, I’m a network guy and not a “proper” developer but the amount of time I’ve saved myself (and my colleagues, and my eventual successor) through automation, scripting, or the odd custom app where I can is insane. Python has been a great help in this, and I picked up the basics by doing the Python 2 course here a few years ago. 


I occasionally have an idea for something I’d like to build, but don’t necessarily have the knowledge to get everything done.


I’ve found quite regularly that having an end goal in mind gives me something to work towards, and that’s much more motivating than simply sitting down and telling myself “right, I guess I have to do another lesson on X…”
You might find that having a “real world” project to work on gives you a similar impetus to expand your knowledge - which, hopefully, you’ll be able to do through an appropriate CC course or by asking us here. 

Codecademy posted a great article on their blog, here it is.

How to stay motivated and not give up when learning to code
If you’re having a hard time staying motivated while learning to code, know that you aren’t alone. We’ve compiled a list of seven tips for staying motivated from the Codecademy community.





"
8,C++ Advanced,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Any idea after completing the c++ course on codecademy. Where to learn more advanced c++ for game development.
","
Some suggestions, these are personal and not hard-and-fast rules:



Continue to build fundamentals, here’s a great list of potential books for study: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list/388282#388282








Draft a list of projects (no limits). Then try to see if you can identify the technical gap from where you are now to what you need to take on one of those projects. If you can’t identify the path clearly, ask around. That will give you a direction towards what kinds of skills you might want to pick up.







Do mini-projects: I like to do mini-projects that start to set foundations to larger projects I want to do. For these, it’s good to have most of the skills to complete them within a reasonable time 1-3 weeks. The idea is that this emphasizes more project management and less worry about the building skills (time-management, structuring, making revisions on the fly, documentation, testing, asking for peer review).




I want to go into the gaming industry[Atleast now I am thinking to create games]
Any good courses you know of?
I already completed the codecademy c++ course. 

There’s a free CS 50 course on youtube for game design. It’s good.
It’s hard to beat having consistent project experience though. You will learn a lot that way.

OK Thanks  for answering

9,How to not forget learned programming languages?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
I’ve always been curious about everything related to computer. I learned lot of things during these years.
Recently, I start coding, following codecademy courses, wich is very good to know foundations of each langage.
I started, 7 days ago, and I finished bash/sell, SQL and currently learning Javascript.
I love learning about coding, and I regret that I not started before.
But, I just notice, that more I learn about javascript, more I forgot about other languages.
How can I remedy it ? I know bash/shell is not that complicated but I ask before I’m going to learn an other language when I’ll finish JS.
Do I must practice more each of these three langage after learning JS for getting their synthaxe automatic for me ? (and then learning an other langage)
Do I must just continuing learning languages , and then practicing language that I have prefered at the end  ?
I don’t write very well in english, sorry if ther are languages errors  !
Thank you in advance !
","
Hello! I would practise each language, either by creating your own project, or doing other projects. If you want to find ready-made projects, a website I like to sometimes use is codewars. It gives you lots of different challenges.

learning JS for getting their synthaxe


Don’t worry about memorising syntax-everyone has to Google things. Just try to remember key details of the language, like what each one does, whether you need to import a module for doing Math.ceil(), etc
I hope this helps!

Thanks you very much for your answer. You’re right. I will practise thse languages !

12,How are the frequency values calculated for the histogram?,"Get Help,General Programming",,9,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how are the frequency values calculated for the histogram?
Answer
For the histogram that you made in this exercise, it is normalized, meaning that the total area under the histogram will add up to 1. With this in mind, we can figure out how the frequencies, or y-axis values, were calculated by doing the following:
First, we need to know the actual width, or range of values, of each individual “bin” of the histogram. The bin width is calculated by the difference of the maximum value minus the minimum value of the dataset, divided by the number of bins we chose. The equation can be seen as follows
bin_width = (max_value - min_value) / number of bins

Next, we just need to ensure that the total area of all the bins added together sums to 1, since this is a normalized histogram. We can do this by adding the area of each bin together, such that the sum is equal to 1. Also, one additional value we now need is a “ratio” such that it is ensured that the total area adds up to 1, due to normalization. We will see this come into play later on.
The equation can be seen as follows, where the count variables are the number of values that fall in each bin.
1 = (bin_width * ratio * count_1) + (bin_width * ratio * count_2) + ...

We can simplify this to
1 = bin_width * ratio * (count_1 + count_2 + ...)

and then shorten it to this,
1 = bin_width * ratio * N

where N is the total number of elements in the dataset.
Finally, we must obtain this ratio value.
1 = bin_width * ratio * N

1 / bin_width = ratio * N

1 / (bin_width * N) = ratio

Now that we have the ratio, we can obtain the frequencies for each bin. To get the frequency, or y-axis value, of a bin, you would use the following equation,
frequency = items_in_bin * ratio

","
Hi team,
I have a small question regarding the frequency equation stated above. What does the items_in_bin refers to? When I read this post from top to bottom, I get disconnected when I reach this particular equation.
Explanation with a simple example would be very much appreciated.
Thanks,
Jimmy

We will need a link to the exercise for context. Please post it in a reply.

Hi there,
I dont think this question is linked to any exercise. This is just a general question about finding the frequency value (y axis) on histogram charts.

I guess one way to find out is to track down that exercise and see what its about. Could answer your question just in the doing.

Hi there,
the link is actually attached on the original post (first line) by jephos249.

I’m not the one that needs to follow up.

Well, I guess I will just have to wait for other Codecademy moderators or users to answer my question.

You’ve already said it was a general question but related it directly to a course. How is anyone who hasn’t taken the course going to be able to answer your question, especially if you haven’t taken the course, either? This is a non-question.

Write an calculator using Java swing OR JavaFX, it should allow for whole terms, variables and builtin functions like sine or cosine… (Translation mine, some parts left out)

It’s a fairly generic term that covers quite a lot of ground. At a guess I think they are referring to ‘prgoramming techniques’ such as looping or conditional statements or something along those lines. If it’s still not clear what they want could you ask your teacher to clarify?
"
14,Beginner Question - What Next After Learning The Foundations?,"Get Help,General Programming",,13,"
Hi,
One thing I never see really explained to a beginner is what is the next step. I’m at the stage where I understand how to write If Statements and Loops etc in VIsual Studio. But other than needing to know that “at some point in the future” I will use it in a project, I don’t see what I can actually do with any of this. Say i wanted to build an app. An app with a visual UI and moving parts etc is a million miles from a black and white screen that produces an If Statement to calculate whether someone is over 18 or not?
Where does the practical use come in? Do you build the UI in Visual Studio or as I suspect, you use Visual Studio to write and debug code and then it is copied and pasted into some other program designed for building an app, or a stock investing algo, or a website? Is that how it works?
Im just wondering how i progress from the sandpit of writing boring drills in Visual Studio and progress that to something real?
Thanks

Writing GUI applications from scratch (although fun), not very practical these days. You can fiddle around with lower level languages like C and very basic GUI libraries to better grasp graphical rendering.
We can often use libraries or frameworks to help us write GUI applications. But there in lies a problem. For what platform do you want to develop your application? which language suits my need? so which frameworks can i then choice from?
you could still write your code in Visual Studio code

Thanks for the reply. But still leaves me questionning how you go from writing something basic in Visual Studio to it actually appearing on a website, or screen or something with real world impact? Do you have to write it in something other than Visual Studio, like an off the shelf app building software that happens to use your chosen language in the backend?

You can write the code in visual studio code.
websites have there own languages (html, css and JS for front-end, and a lot of choice in the back-end). you can easily create a html file with visual studio code and then use your browser to render this page.
There are tools like QT for C++ which include some drag and drop when designing the GUI of you app. But the more complex and underlying logic still requires code


But still leaves me questionning how you go from writing something basic in Visual Studio to it actually appearing on a website, or screen or something with real world impact?

Check out subreddits for webdev or specific languages or frameworks (Python, JS, Flask). I haven’t checked the CSS subreddit but I follow a few yt channels and there’s a lot of great things happening there too.
People there share their projects all the time and you’ll see that the meat of the functionality is done through code in a text editor (Visual Studio, Sublime, Atom, etc).
The real world impact is in the functionality, the aesthetic design is a means to that end (nevertheless important).
Another way you can think of it is: What apps do you think have an impact? How would you describe what they do? One could argue that programming is gaining the knowledge and creativity to bring that descriptive narrative into a technical reality.

I’m at the stage where I understand how to write If Statements and Loops etc in VIsual Studio. But other than needing to know that “at some point in the future” I will use it in a project

If-statements and loops are incredibly useful foundational bread-and-butter tools. Some of the best tools are sometimes unimpressive at first glance. But to those that work with them they cherish the versatility their simplicity brings.
In sports, the “pass” is a similarly common basic that when applied by elite athletes has the ability to bring people to tears. In music, playing a scale in tune is another example: alone it doesn’t do anything, but when we think about our favorite moments in music they are often in tune!

It’s a long way from soft boiled egg to souffle. Basic programming is learning to boil water. Put the ambition to build an app out of your mind and concentrate on the fundamentals. Work with the rudiments until it hurts. Don’t race ahead thinking you will learn any faster. Stay in the shallow end and gradually you will make it into deeper water, but with confidence in your ability with the small stuff.

Thanks all, really good points raised. Once I really cement the basic techniques I will look to the subReddits and Youtube to see the next steps.
Still find it hard to see how printing things in VS’s console window can be translated into a useable bit of software…
Maybe an example would help, I come from a derivatives trading background and my interest in coding came from actually being made redundant because the trading techniques I used could be automated.
A lot of financial roles require C# or Python now. So with the comment in mind of “how does Visual Studio’s console window relate to something practical” am I correct in thinking eventually you would get to a point where you would pull in data from outside of VS and get your code to reference that data and say something like “If the current price is higher than yesterday’s highest price then buy” and VS would be able to speak directly with your broker.
Or… would it be more the case your broker would have a C# environment already created that would know what the words “price” and “buy” actually mean and you would build such a system in their application in the language of C# or Python? Am I along the right lines?
I use a financial example as that’s the world I know, but i guess the same could be applied to apps, or websites, or accountancy software etc. You would actually use a language to build functions in their environment so there would be a library of words and GUI’s to bring it all together?
thanks again

Personally, I’m not a big fan of fancy IDEs for beginners. The less they have to work with the more they can concentrate on learning the critical rudiments. If it’s Python you are working with, then learn how to use IDLE, from python.org.
Download, install, and be sure to put a shortcut on your taskbar. When you click that link it should open the interactive shell. If you click the file menu and select New File it will open the text editor. Save, but don’t navigate to a new directory, just save it in the provided Scripts folder that is part of the Python installation.
You’ll spend a lot of time working in the shell, on small stuff. Reams and reams of small stuff. Simple tasks. Learn all the ins and outs by working with the basics. Cool your jets and quit thinking there is a fast track. There isn’t.

Also, we can save a copy of the current shell. I created a shells folder in the Scripts folder, and I just use the date as the filename.

I make it a habit to save the shell when I first open it. That way as you work you can continue to save. The file itself won’t be executable but the code examples, trials, mistakes, error messages, etc. will always be there to look back on. Just remember to Save before you close the shell.


You would actually use a language to build functions in their environment so there would be a library of words and GUI’s to bring it all together?

Close, you don’t really even need a gui though to make the functions run and give you useful info. What is interesting is visualizing the data if you’re going more for financial usage.
There’s a whole world of machine-learning that can try to predict trends from datasets.
A real simple example is a set of data points of housing in California:

longitude
latitude
housing median age
total rooms
total bedrooms
population, households
median income
median house value
ocean proximity

With these points, you can build a model to predict a district’s median housing price (with say: python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).
I’m not that well-versed in it, but it seems to be a blossoming field.
I share this to give you an idea of some real-world applications you personally might be interested in.




 toastedpitabread:

applications you personally might be interested in.


But should be well versed in Python basics and intermediate level coding. This is not something to learn, but to apply given previous knowledge of not just Python, but statistics and other maths.

100%, all of the above can only be considered after having a firm grasp of the fundamentals in its field. I’m assuming since he does finance though, he will have some background in statistics, etc.

Hence, “…, apply…”.

15,Where can i go to use what i learn from the JS course?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hello, I’m new to these forums and signed up with the pro membership because I really want to take my coding journey to the next level and have as many resources available to me as possible. So, right now I’m learning JS, and I’m doing ok i guess. I’m still a little rusty with string interpolations and definitely with the if else statements and the swtich part of it. I’m really trying to use what I learn by doing mini-projects, the thing is…does this website have a source mainly dedicated for projects to practice what I learn or what is their a recommended website for this? I ask because I understand that doing real-world projects and applying and making mistakes is the best way to learn and retain information. Thank you for your time and consideration, hope to hear back from you guys

There are a number of projects available to you through Codecademy if you have Pro.
Though if you don’t you can certainly create your own projects either online or on your own computer.
An online IDE like repl will allow you to write and run JS and many other languages online, and share your code on the cloud.
If you really want to get into it, than the best option might be to set up an environment on your computer.
First thing you need is a text editor. There are a number of good ones available including:

Atom
Sublime
VS code

After this you need an engine capable of running JavaScript.
A popular one is nodeJS.

There’s a website called Codewars, which isn’t a text-editor or IDE, but you can find interesting problems on the languages you choose, which may help you to cement your knowledge.

16,What are examples of programs we use every day?,"Get Help,General Programming",,10,"
Question
In the context of the lesson, what are examples of programs we use every day?
Answer
If you have a computer or smartphone, then chances are you use programs every day.
Every computer runs on an operating system, which are programs that help us to have file systems, run applications, and connect hardware like mouses or keyboards to interact with the software.
Smartphones also run on operating systems, and usually have many “apps” or applications that you might use like an alarm clock or fitness tracker. These “apps” are programs.
Internet browsers like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer are programs that are used very frequently, and required if we need to perform searches on the internet or check our email.
Furthermore, if we want to watch a movie or listen to music on our computer, we use programs in the form of media players like Windows Media Player or VLC player.
Programs have become quite important and are an integral part of many peoples’ day-to-day lives!
","
Calculator and watch are essentials for me.

How about microwave oven, coffee maker, kitchen range, washing machine, clothes dryer, alarm clock, VCR or DVD player, &c.?

MacOS, Windows, Android, Games, Apps etc

Auto mode in a car, asking alexa about weather.

Pretty much all of my audio programs for when I do audio engineering work. And my smart TV

How about an electric vehicle? Or a car?

Yes, with smart cars on the rise we’re starting to see more code involved with modern vehicles.

Video games, Alexa, Coffee machine, TV, Computers.
Regards…

Banking and financial software, weather apps, “smart” household appliances,  internet shopping, inventory control, “smart” traffic control, automatic timers especially those that monitor and react to certain conditions, interactive toys, security systems, phone system greeting menus, satellite tracking software, email, vehicle emissions controls, social media, breaking news alerts, and electronic calendars are just a few of the many software programs that I can think of that I use on a daily basis.  Fun little exercise.

Which of the couple “Web Deleveopment”-courses are recommended for my need?

You’ll probably want a mix of the web-dev (HTML, CSS, Javascript), SQL, python (geared towards pandas for producing reports) + some framework.

Hi,
Thanks.
This one would be ok?
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development
The only thing is that it does not contian Python. Python is needed for the API programming, right? In the one above Node.JS is taking that part, right?
Or, are there some areas where Python is unreplaceable?
Cheerrs,
Dime

It’s for the backend if you’re going to use flask or django.
You could do PHP/laravel instead too.
If you want want more specific pros and cons look for webdev forums where they specifically go over pros/cons of django vs laravel vs nodejs.
I personally think python is one of the easier language to learn and its useful and easy to use flask (personally). I wouldn’t immediately jump to node.js for something like this but that’s a personal preference.

I need to revise it again and again, but i just don’t know the art of note making. I am facing it hard to figure out the notemaking strategy. Please tell me if someone have done this before. Please Help!
","
Hello @tomarrajattomar, welcome to the forums!
To take notes effectively, wait until you reach the end of the lesson where it provides the ‘review’ page-outlining everything that you learnt in that lesson. When you reach that page, write out a description and code example for every item provided, in a way you can understand. Then, retrace the lesson, and review your notes, and check for any gaps. If you find any, redo the lesson/exercise and repeat the process.
Another good way of cementing knowledge is to create projects-no matter how small-being able to apply what you’ve learnt will really help cement the knowledge you’ve learnt.
I hope this helps!

Thank you so much! It has helped a lot.

I use Google Docs to make notes and I jot something down as I progress through each lesson. Using an online format such as Docs allows me to organise the format into lessons, modules etc, easier to edit and synced across all devices and easier to search for a specific term.
Also be consistent with the note taking, if you keep getting into a pattern of note taking it’ll become easier and more natural.

Draw out maps of the relationships if you need to. But let your brain take it in passively over the days. It will start getting used to it before you know it. (DO play around with the ideas, DON’T kill yourself when you can’t remember what does what).

30,What is the opposite of churn rate?,"Get Help,General Programming",,9,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what is the opposite of churn rate?
Answer
The opposite of churn rate is usually referred to as the retention rate.
While the churn rate shows how many people have canceled a service, the retention rate shows how many people have chosen to renew, or are returning customers.
The calculation for churn and retention can vary on the implementation, but usually the calculation is
retention rate = 100% - churn rate
So, if the churn rate is 20.8%, then the retention rate is
100% - 20.8% = 79.1%
","
is usually referred to as the retention rate

Wouldn’t the retention rate be 79.2% or is it rounded down for a reason that I am missing?

It’s just a typo. I guess they will fix it, eventually.

Hello,
Is the significance of churn rate in the exercise to show that it is a function of SQL?

If  [quote=“jephos249, post:1, topic:384043”]
the retention rate shows how many people have chosen to renew, or are returning customers.
[/quote] , isn’t the calculation meant to be based on those who renewed or return than based on the total number of customer?

Hi Jephos 249
How to find out the churn rate of April?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS ‘enrollments’,
COUNT(CASE
WHEN strftime(""%m"", cancel_date) = ‘04’

ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE

FROM pro_users

33,Is machine learning the same as artificial intelligence?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, is machine learning the same as artificial intelligence?
Answer
No, although similar in some ways, machine learning and artificial intelligence are different things. Machine learning is actually a subset of artificial intelligence, which is a broader field encompassing other concepts which include machine learning, robotics, and natural language processing.
Artificial intelligence can be described as when machines carry out tasks in an intelligent or smart way, based on set rules to solve certain problems. Artificial intelligence, or AI, makes decisions, learns, and solves problems similar to how humans would.
Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is when we give machines data and have them learn from that data on their own, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning models learn from the data and try to make improvements to its predictions over time.
Machine learning is a technique that is used to accomplish artificial intelligence, but even without machine learning, artificial intelligence can still work. In a way, machine learning provides more efficient ways to make predictions on certain data, but is just a small part of artificial intelligence as a whole.

34,Why not add Lua?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"

I really hope that Codecademy will add a Lua course as it is a good programming language to embed in scripts and programs! 😉


I am learning Luau (Roblox Lua). But I simply can't remember what a section of a code does when I look at it. Why not add a Lua course so that people can come here to learn Lua and Codecademy will be more popular as since there isn't any good place to learn Lua! I am really hoping that Codecademy will add a course so that game developers can also embed Lua in their code and make their game better! (Though I want to learn Lua so that I can learn Luau (Roblox's altered version of it, formerly RBX) better! And to probably embed Lua in my code (if I ever become a good programmer)!)
","
I’m going to take a guess, I don’t actually know and I don’t work for CC:
Codecademy probably does studies to measure demand versus what the popular demand for junior jobs in the market is currently. If it’s not on their radar it’s probably because the cost of creating a course for it outweighs the demand combined with how likely students of that language will go on to get jobs in the field.
The other guess is that for the most part CC likes to keep activity on their website, for Lua one needs to use Love to run the files. So it is a lot of off-platform time which is harder to control for quality.
These are just wild guesses, I could be totally off base.
However if you want to learn Lua, if you learn Python or Java (or C++!) it well it wouldn’t be hard to pickup Lua. I’ve done both and Lua code always seems readable and straight-forward.
From what I’ve seen, C++ is one of the more in-demand languages in gaming (though you’d have to do your own research to verify). So if you learn C++ not only do you set yourself up for lua, but you can build skill in a language that’s already in demand in the gaming field.
Hope this helps! Again, I never studied Lua so you might want to check other forums for more thorough discussions. I’ve seen a lot of threads on good skills/languages to study in the indiedevelopers subreddit and places like it.

You should study lua! It’s easier than Python and if you learn or know C++, you can embed Lua code in the program! Just like Roblox(A mix of mostly C++ but Lua used for game logic and physics?)! Many developers have quit their jobs, learnt Lua, and made games in Roblox just to earn money!

tried using goto also wont work

To repeat actions you need a loop. Unless you already know how many times you want to repeat, you’ll probably want a while loop, so you can end execution of your code when a specific condition is met. Here is a very simple example:
from random import choice
user_input = 'hello'
responses = [""I'm sleepy"", ""Do you like bananas?"", ""How many is seven?"", ""I like bananas."", ""Do you have any grapes?""]
print(""Hello, my name is Bot. Type 'quit' any time to quit."")

while user_input != 'quit':
    print(choice(responses))
    user_input = input(""Say something: "")
    
print(""Well, okay then. Bye!"")



Sample output:

Hello, my name is Bot. Type ‘quit’ any time to quit.
I like bananas.
Say something: Good for you.
I like bananas.
Say something: I know. You’ve mentioned it.
I’m sleepy
Say something: Take a nap.
How many is seven?
Say something: Umm. 7
Do you have any grapes?
Say something: No. Do you?
I like bananas.
Say something: Apparently.
I like bananas.
Say something: quit
Well, okay then. Bye!



does the while loop wait until the function is finished?? and can i run a function from another?

also anyway the code needs its itself, so i cant have any luck predefine-ing




 rajehtxd6360104456:

does the while loop wait until the function is finished?


The code inside of the while loop will repeat until the condition is met. You could have multiple function calls inside a while loop. Those functions can call other functions.

can i predefine functions from others
ex.
def a():
b()
def b():
print(“hello”)
a()
while true:
a()

Yes. Expounding on your example a bit:
def a():
    b()
    
def b():
    print(""Hello!"")
    
a()

condition = """"

while condition != ""quit"":
    a()
    #need to make sure that condition gets updated inside the loop else you'll have an infinite loop
    #probably by asking for user input in your case
    condition = input(""Type 'quit' to quit. "")



Sample output:
Hello!
Hello!
Type ‘quit’ to quit. nope
Hello!
Type ‘quit’ to quit. no
Hello!
Type ‘quit’ to quit. quit


THANK YOU SO MUCH <3. But isn’t there a way to continue the loop without continuously typing?
Isn’t while true is used for that??
isn’t there a way to type “q” and close? and not just type it every time? i guess I’ll have to stick to macro-ing if that isn’t the case

Maybe i just while true inside
while condition != ""quit"":
while True: 
 a()
    condition = input(""Type 'quit' to quit. "")


That was just an example. If you are making a chat bot, the user presumably will be typing responses continually. The line of code taking the user input should be inside the while loop, so that if they type ‘quit’ or whatever you want the trigger word to be to end, the loop will end. You wouldn’t have to specifically ask the user to type ‘quit’ to quit repeatedly. I wrote the following just for fun a few days ago after discussing this topic with you.

from random import choice
from random import choices
user_input = ''
statements = [""I'm sleepy"", ""I'm hungry."", ""I like bananas."", ""I don't think I like monkeys very much."", ""Bananas are nutritious and delicious."", ""I think it's time to eat."", ""I don't like banana jokes. I think it's rude to make fun of bananas."", ""Banana bread is yummy!"", ""I love banana pudding!"", ""I don't have any pets."", ""If I had a pet, it wouldn't be a monkey. I know that much.""]
questions = [""Do you like bananas?"", ""Do you have any grapes?"", ""Is it time to eat?"", ""Do you know any banana farmers?"", ""How do you feel about monkeys?"", ""If a monkey came here, do you think it would eat my bananas?"", ""Why do monkeys even exist?"", ""If you had two bananas, would you let me eat one?"", ""If you and I were to share three bananas, would we split the third one long ways or short ways?"", ""Do you know any banana jokes?""]
jokes = [""Why did the monkey cross the road?"", ""Why does it take three monkeys to change a light bulb?"", ""Why do monkeys swing in trees?""]
answers = [""To steal my bananas!"", ""to steal your bananas?"", ""to steal your bananas""]

def ask():
  return questions[choice(range(1000)) % len(questions)]

def say():
  return statements[choice(range(1000)) % len(statements)]

def joke():
  user_answer = input(f""\n{tell_joke()} "")
  return answers[0] if user_answer not in answers else ""Exactly!!""

def tell_joke():
  return jokes[choice(range(1000)) % len(jokes)]

def burp():
  return ""BUUUURRRRPPP!! Excuse me.""

bot_actions = [ask, say, joke, burp]

print(""Hello, my name is Bot. Type 'quit' to quit."")

while user_input != 'quit':
    print(""\n"" + choices(bot_actions, weights=[10, 10, 5, 1])[0]())
    user_input = input(""\nYour response: "")
    
print(""\nWell, okay then. Bye!"")

# Using questions[choice(range(1000)) % len(questions)] seemed to increase the randomness as opposed to just using `choice(questions)` which seemed to yield many repeats.


I assume you are building something much more complex, but this may give you some ideas for the basic structure.

while True: # This will be an infinite loop. There's no way to change the condition.

Something like this would work:
while True:
    x = input(""say something: "")
    if x == 'quit': break

print(""I quit!"")


Thank you for your amazing help, but sadly, this is not how you thought it would work, the bot is reading messages left and right on a WhatsApp group chat, and responding to the typical, the user shouldn’t be able to quit the program, only i can. Because i would run the bot, and only i should quit the bot for any reason. The user isn’t communicating on the console, we are just checking for a sufficient question to respond to. Example !link will make the bot reply with, a link for a tutorial video, or a specific website.

36,How to make a pop-up form with CRUD in angular 9?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Hi all,
I have made a pop-up form in a table . On the clicking of add button on the top right of the table the modal opens with details to fill . On filling the details in the form and clicking save button of the modal I need to perform CRUD. Where add ,delete and update needs to be performed ,so that the form details are added to the table . Which can be further deleted or updated.
My problem is that I don’t know how to perform CRUD because I am very new to angular.Also I am not supposed to use angular material table or jquery.I don’t need an API it’s just basic CRUD. I have used html ,css,bootstrap and angular. Can you provide me with a link or video that solves my problem.
Thanks

37,How can we think more intuitively about the Testing for a Rare Diseases problem?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Question
In  this exercise, we consider a rare disease affecting 1% of the population and an accurate test for this disease – 99% accuracy. Despite this accuracy, we see in this exercise that you’re very unlikely to have the disease even if the test returns positive. How do we intuitively make sense of this?
Answer
The following image is a helpful aid for thinking about this problem.

Screen Shot 2018-10-26 at 3.54.12 PM.png1440×900 73.3 KB

As we can see here, although in a group of 1000 people there will be 95 true positives, that is, 95 people who both have the disease and receive a positive test, there are far more, 495 to be exact, false positives, that is, 495 people who don’t have the disease and receive a positive test. This is because 1% inaccuracy from a large group of people, the 99% of people who don’t have the disease, is still a large number and so outweighs the large percentage accuracy from a comparatively very small group.
","
In the text description underneath the image, shouldn’t it be “… in a group of 100 people…” instead of 1000, and the value for inaccuracy 5% instead of 1%?

Agree, these numbers dont jive…though the way I see is that it should read “…in a group of 10,000 people…” and the value for inaccuracy 5%.

True, I agree. Thank you for your response!

I would advise the @Codeacademy staff to make the text align with the image, otherwise it is really confusing. The image shows a 95% accurate test in a 10000 people population. While the text talks about a 99% accurate test in a 1000 people population.

I believe the issue is is in your very first loop. According to the exercise the first digit on the right is a check digit, then you iterate backwards. However, in your first for loop you are starting with the check digit (index length-1), and leaving out the first digit (index 0). You want to write the loop in such a way that you’re excluding the check digit, and including the first digit. Then it should give you the correct result.

replaced i > 0 with i >=0, but still says “invalid number” even though computation is correct
function validateCred(array) {

  emptyArray = [];

  everyOther = [];

  array2 = [];

  for (let x=0; array.length >=)

  

  for (let i=array2.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {

    emptyArray.push(array2[i]);

  }

  

  for (let j=1; j < emptyArray.length; j += 2) {

    everyOther.push(emptyArray[j]);

  }

  modified = everyOther.map(function multiply(s){

    let multiplied = s*2;

    if (multiplied > 9){

    return multiplied - 9;

    }else{

      return multiplied;

    }

  })

  let sum = modified.reduce((a, b) => a+b, 0);

  if(sum%10 == 0) {

    console.log(""credit card number is valid"")

  }else {

    console.log(""credit card number is invalid"")}

Ah I think I see the issue. modified is the array of every other element, however you still need to add the rest of the elements that didn’t need to be doubled. So what you should be getting as your final sum for this number is 80, however it’s 25 as you’re only adding the ones you doubled.
So you’ll need to find a way of getting the sum of the remaining elements and then adding that onto your sum, which should then make it valid.

It’s always good to get visuals on what’s going on in loops. Not only does it solve problems, but it strengthens recognition of patters 

Can’t figure out how to add “modified” to “sumArray”

39,Can linear regression apply to more than two variables?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, can linear regression apply to more than two variables?
Answer
Yes, in this lesson we only considered linear regression between one dependent variable and one independent variable. However, linear regression can also be applied between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This is known as multiple linear regression, which you can learn more about in later lessons in the “Machine Learning” course.
Similar to linear regression, multiple linear regression finds a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
For an example, linear regression between one dependent and one independent variable would apply in a situation to find the relationship between the market price of a house with the square footage. However, with multiple linear regression, we may find the relationship of the market price, number of rooms, and location with the square footage.

40,The application of what codeacademy teaches,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
I’ve recently started learning here in codeacademy, and you could say that I’m new to this world of programming.
I chose the Computer Science path, but I can’t find an explanation anywhere as to how are we to apply all the material that we’re being taught here. So for example, I’m studyin python here, but I couldnt really figure out: a) what Python is being used FOR
b) after i’ve mastered the python syntax and techniques, how do I use it outside of codeacademy? how do I use python (as an example) to create a program with a graphic interface for users, outside of the codeacademy practice sheet? in other words, how do I take a program I created in python and make it look like a legitimate user friendly program?
are these questions the courses here cover?
I hope I made my questions clear! thanks in advance!
","



 arielneil:

a) what Python is being used FOR


python is used in a lot, from build modules to data science and back-end web development.
Building a GUI with python is not so common. Although there libraries available (PyQT en kivy come to mind). But python would not be my first choice for a GUI app. Depending on platform and other things, i would very likely Java or C# for GUI programming.
There is also tkinter, but that is more for practice. That GUI looks old, like it was made over a decade ago.
Its not something the course covers, codecademy mostly focuses on teaching programming concepts.

For Python specifically I’m not sure, but in general the big self-working projects provided are really good for actually seeing how all this comes together in practise. There’s also nothing to stop you coming up with your own projects, for example I was learning HTML, CSS and JS, and I’m using it to build a fully interactive periodic table on my own time and from scratch. For C++ and Java I’m working towards building my own small games, helped largely due to the self-working projects.
In terms of python specifically I don’t believe they use UI’s too often, at least none of the python programs I have used do. Just like any online course you’ll need to do your own outside research to really get to a strong place, however Codecademy is really good at teaching the fundamentals, and some courses do offer that kind of training (eg. the Android Java development course or the Web Development course).

Hi @arielneil welcome to the forums!
It is difficult to see the connection between learning difficult concepts and applying them in real life. I get it! 
I only know Python as it relates to data science & analysis. It might be good to just simply google how python is used (in conjunction w/other apps like Django) in building a website.
I agree w/@adamgaffney137183916 about coming up with your own projects to apply the skills you’re learning. I know its hard to see how everything fits together in the big picture, but picking something to build that interests you is a great way to keep skills in check and learn more at the same time.

@arielneil I personally subscribe to python subreddits (like Flask, pygame, Django, Machine Learning) to see the projects people come up with.
They often share them with full code and explanation of the creative process!
It pushes buttons in my head to combine the ideas in different ways. So a lot of my current/future projects are shaped by the ideas I see from what people do with it.

good idea about Reddit. (I never would have thought of that).
You could also follow people on Github if they make their code/projects public.

The projects, as @adamgaffney137183916 mentioned, offer a good intro to applying the concepts you’ve learned.

Hi there.
An immediate thing I noticed as wrong is the relative path to your Yelp.js file.
Your working tree (from the src directory) should look something like this:
src
├── components
│   ├── App
│   ├── Business
│   ├── BusinessList
│   └── SearchBar
└── util

so from the App folder, where App.js lives, you need to go up 2 directories before going down one level into util for Yelp.js.
I’ll take a look at come back if I spot anything else. 
Edit: I wouldn’t have done this line in Business.js this way:
const business = this.props;
If you wanted to shorten the typing elsewhere, you should probably have assigned this.props.business to const business rather than all the props as you have done. Won’t break anything, I don’t think, but I wouldn’t think it to be best practice either. 
Edit 2: Can’t see anything else in your code which is functionally different to how I did it… so I think it’s just your path which is wrong. 
Let us know if that doesn’t fix it. 


This is what i saw on the web page when i removed const business = this.props;
And also on Webstorm (the app that I’m using to write the JSX and JavaScript) it told me that this is the correct file path:

import Yelp from ‘…/util/Yelp’

^^ 2 dots not 3
Idk what else I’m missing. And btw, thanks for reaching out and helping me!

Yes. I didn’t say remove it, though.
At the moment, you’re saving the entire props object to const business… which, in this case, is fine because it’s not a complex props… but if it were more complex that could get confusing quickly.
What I meant was you could change that line to const business = this.props.business so that the name of the constant reflects the prop you’re putting into it.

One of the early steps in the Ravenous project is to create the components directory, with the App subdirectory, and move the App.js and App.css files into it so that each component is in its own directory. The util directory which gets created later is meant, I think, to be on the same level as the components directory.
Don’t suppose there’s much chance of getting a screenshot or something of the folder structure you’ve set up? (Not sure if Webstorm shows it?)

Oh OK, I see now: “const business = this.props.business” instead of "" const business = this.props"".
And also here is a pic of the folder, “App” and “components” are 2 directories in the src directory:

Does this example help? If you’re having trouble making sure it’s an array that you’re returning, just make sure by logging before you return it
const test_array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const test_map = test_array.map(x => x * 4);

Yeah, assign it to a variable.

so you’re having trouble returning that array? if you format (</> button) the code it’ll be easier to interpret what’s happening.

I just clicked on “preformatted text”

You have to highlight it and then press </>

Ok, it seems like you’re calling everyOther.map and it returns something, but that something isn’t being stored (for it to work with the rest of the validateCred() function) . That might be the issue.

Fixed it
const batch = [valid1, valid2, valid3, valid4, valid5, invalid1, invalid2, invalid3, invalid4, invalid5, mystery1, mystery2, mystery3, mystery4, mystery5];

// Add your functions below:

function validateCred(array) {

  emptyArray = [];

  everyOther = [];

  for (let i=array.length-1; i > 0; i--) {

    emptyArray.push(array[i]);

  }

  

  for (let j=1; j < emptyArray.length; j += 2) {

    everyOther.push(emptyArray[j]);

  }

  modified = everyOther.map(function multiply(s){

    let multiplied = s*2;

    if (multiplied > 9){

    return multiplied - 9;

    }else{

      return multiplied;

    }

  })

  return [emptyArray, everyOther, modified];

console.log(validateCred(valid5))

Great!
I personally find it useful to just play around and experiment with single elements of these bigger functions to see how they behave (bending and breaking ) before applying them on a bigger scale.
If I’m ever doing anything large, I really only consider tools that I know very strongly… So the preparatory experimentation I mentioned sets a great foundation for dealing with complex structures and concepts.
That’s also why I gave a simplified example. If something doesn’t work in a big app I’m writing, I first try to abstract it in the simplest terms possible. It’s not unusual that I’ll learn something unexpected about something I thought I knew fairly well!

Hello,
Well if you built your client a static website, then no there’s no way to modify the content other than modifying the code (so, yes, maintenance I suppose would be on you).
If you want your clients to be able to modify content on their pages, you’d have to use an exisisting CMS, or build your own and provide it as part of the service.

This is probably really silly, but in the code if you put return numberToRemove = 1 after the if statement, the code won’t run properly. I am just wondering, w hy would this be the case?

Not silly at all. So the question is how will it not run properly… when you call the drop() function: is it throwing an error, is it dropping another number, is it not returning the array altogether?

Thanks a lot btw!

I might’ve mentioned in another post but it’s really useful to put tracers of all your values when you don’t know where to start digging.
Particularly, you should look into what your newArray is.
Double check what slice does too.
Whenever you have arrays, don’t forget about 0-indexing 
Try putting in other values, 1 might not be working, but if you put in other values with your tracers, something might click in your head as to why 1 didn’t work.
It’s ok if you don’t get it now! The point is to push yourself to ask the questions, and position the answers to appear for you. Your brain might actually solve it by itself before your next study session…

Its 3am in the UK haha, is it ok if i can try it tomorrow evening and report back to you? I think my brain is fried, since that lodash task had 43 exercises and took my ages to get through haha
As always thanks so much for taking the time to respond and help me 
Edit: Ok so I quickly checked everything and it all logs fine, I think the issue is the 'return"" part, if I put return numberToRemove it goes wrong?

Yea you definitely don’t want to return numbertoremove because that’s not what you want your function to do (it should return an array, not a number).
And rest is vital for life and also learning haha, take a break.
Cheers.

thanks - why exactly is it so bad to return a number tho, because numbertoremove can still be used in the let newArray = array.slice(numberToRemove) to then return a new array. Any ideas? I just don’t get it.
@mtf any ideas either if you don’t mind me asking?

well, remember you only get to return once in a function (since a return ends the function).
If the goal of your function is to take a specific number out, it implies that you want the remainder minus that specific number (hence, returning the array and not the numberToRemove).
You also already have the numberToRemove to begin with since that’s what you input into the parameters.
It’s ok to return a number in general! Just not in this function. If you wanted the function to do something else, then it would have a different name too. The drop name implies that you are dropping x num from y array.

AHHH that makes so much sense!! So you can only return once, I didn’t know that! I thought it was once per statement…and since they were on different lines I thought it would only end the if statement not the entire function. That makes so much more sense.
Thanks man

Look at what it’s logging for random_number. Your prompt asks for a number from 1-10 but the random_number generator you wrote might not be doing what you think it does.

It doesn’t work either way. Please try it out.

The javascript works ok! (note: i took the prompt out to check it in the my text editor). You might want to add a ; at the end of those statements though.

why both are incorrect?

0 and 1 are incorrect. But either of them should be.

To get to the bottom of this, you should also log what the prompt input is, and also console.log(guess === random_number).
You’ll be surprised! Why does this happen?

Try these
console.log(typeof random_number)
console.log(typeof guess)

@ramutis you’ll notice that the types don’t match! If you want things to be strictly equivalent (that’s what the 3 = are for) then you should add an operation that converts the types to match.

Got it.   Thanks. I’ll know from now on.

You could’ve also written guess == random_number to avoid conversion. But this is not necessarily a good habit to have.
@ramutis 2 = signs ignore type, while 3 = require a perfect match.

51,Instance vs class methods?,"Get Help,General Programming",,16,"
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/web-dev-js-arrays-loops-objects/modules/learn-javascript-objects/lessons/advanced-objects/exercises/object-methods
I’m doing this exercise and it mentions instance and class methods. Looked on MDN and still confused it says:
There are object instance methods:
a) .hasOwnProperty(propertyName) //boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property rather than inheriting it.
b) .valueOf // will return the primitive value of an object - i.e. its initial value before it was altered.
There are object class/static methods:
a) Object.assign()
b) Object.entries()
c) Object.keys()
What actually is the difference between them?
Secondly, I don’t quite get what object.prototype refers to on MDN. Because if prototype is what enables object methods to be inherited shouldn’t it be prototype.object (since prototype is the overarching one)?
Thanks so much for any  help!
","
Object.assign() is a function copies one object’s properties to another object.
Object.entries() returns object properties in key value pairs.
Object.keys() returns an array of strings representing an inputted object’s property names. (just the names not the key:value pairs)
Is that what you meant by difference? Or are you thinking in what contexts would they be used?
Here’s a free and very useful book on JS (https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
You can read more on the theory there 




 board1774168228:

don’t quite get what object.prototype refers to


That would be, Object.prototype. Object is the root class of everything in JS. It is the top of the prototype chain, save for null which is the very top.
Other objects do not inherit from Object, but from its prototype, the object that contains all methods That’s why we see,
Array.prototype.push()

When we create a class, instances do not inherit from the class, directly, but from its constructor prototype.
class Foo {
    constructor(foo, bar) {
        this.foo = foo;
        this.bar = bar;
    }
    foo_speak () {
        console.log(`Aw, ${this.foo}!`)
    }
    bar_speak () {
        console.log(`Aw, ${this.bar}!`)
    }
}
foo = new Foo('foo', 'bar')
foo.foo_speak()
foo.bar_speak()
console.log(foo.constructor.prototype.hasOwnProperty('foo_speak'))
console.log(foo.constructor.prototype.hasOwnProperty('bar_speak'))

Output
Aw, foo!
Aw, bar!
true
true


Now consider how we can extend a class with more methods, even when there are already existing instances…
Foo.prototype.combine = function () {
    return `${this.foo}${this.bar}`
}
console.log(foo.combine())
//  foobar

Thanks for all your help today btw! It does clarify things but I was actually wondering why
a) Object.assign()
b) Object.entries()
c) Object.keys()
are static methods but the above are under a different category. I’ll have a look at the book thanks!! Yes more the context, but i think someone answered it below. Thanks so much anyways…

Aw, bar!

Thanks for taking the time to explain this, I think I get the gist of it.
In the example, however,  why did you put this.foo = foo; underneath the constructor? Like does it mean foo can just be accessed anywhere? If so why wasn’t it foo = this.foo;?
And you said ""instances do not inherit from the class, directly, but from its constructor prototype"". However, in the example, foo (the instance of the Foo class) inherits .foo_speak() from the class Foo, rather than the constructor, hence why you call foo.foo_speak() rather than foo.constructor.foo_speak(), surely?
I think overall what you are trying to say is that there is a class called Object and underneath there is another nested object called prototype, which houses the constructors and methods. But this is built in javascript so we don’t need to declare an instance of each object we create using ourObjectName = new Object.prototype ();?


Blockquote Now consider how we can extend a class with more methods, even when there are already existing instances…

Foo.prototype.combine = function () {
    return `${this.foo}${this.bar}`
}
console.log(foo.combine())
//  foobar

So foo.combine is now a static method rather than an instance method?
Does that mean any method accessed using the Object.prototype methods are instance methods, whereas any new methods created such as combine that are based only the specific instance of that class are static methods?
So to go back to my initial question, since both Object.assign() and .hasOwnProperty are built in, why is one an instance method and another a static method?




 board1774168228:

why wasn’t it foo = this.foo ;?


foo is the formal parameter and has no value outside of the constructor. We need to assign it to the instance so it becomes a property value. this.foo is the new instance property.
If you haven’t studied class or custom constructors yet then this won’t make a lot of sense.



 board1774168228:

why you call foo.foo_speak() rather than foo.constructor.foo_speak()


The methods are bound to the constructor prototype but JS knows where to find them in the prototype chain. The same way in the following we don’t write .prototype when invoking the method…
Array.prototype.push()  =>  array.push()

The constructor is not part of the prototype. It has a prototype.
The Object class built in to JavaScript has it’s own way to identity data types so that when we define an object of any type, it knows what object wrapper to give it.
s = ""string""

The value above is primitive, but in the assignment is given a String object wrapper. s has no type since it’s just a variable. The object it is assigned does have a type, the one given it by Object. The type of an object is what binds it to its class constructor.
s = ""string""

is very similar to,
s = new String('string')




 board1774168228:

So foo.combine is now a static method rather than an instance method?


I’m not sure we can call it static since it cannot be invoked by the class itself, only the instances.
console.log(Foo.combine())
                ^

TypeError: Foo.combine is not a function



Blockquote
foo  is the formal parameter and has no value outside of the constructor. We need to assign it to the instance so it becomes a property value.  this.foo  is the new instance property.
If you haven’t studied  class  or custom constructors yet then this won’t make a lot of sense.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain this all! I haven’t studied class or custom constructors, I’m around 33% of the web development careers path, so not sure if I will. I will try to understand it anyways.
I think I do understand what you’re saying but I’m not quite sure. To recap:


You’re saying that when we assign variables say x = 1, this is essentially the same as:
x = new Number(number).
What is happening is that javascript identifies the data type as being number and then automatically gives it the number object wrapper. This then binds it to the numbers related constructor.


Inside this constructor, there is a prototype object, which has various methods (which represent the built in methods).


When we call these methods, they are automatically bound to prototype so although MDN may write x.prototype.methodName(), we can simply call x.methodName() and can omit .prototype. We also don’t have to include .constructor before .prototype because the prototype and constructors are bound together since constructors specific to the data type/object wrapper have prototypes. And javascript knows how to find methods inside the constructor.prototype?


Is that correct would you say? My only question then is what happens to the ‘Object’ class,

Block Quote
class Foo {
constructor(foo, bar) {
this.foo = foo;
this.bar = bar;
}
foo_speak () {
console.log(Aw, ${this.foo}!)
}
bar_speak () {
console.log(Aw, ${this.bar}!)
}
}
foo = new Foo(‘foo’, ‘bar’)
foo.foo_speak()
foo.bar_speak()
console.log(foo.constructor.prototype.hasOwnProperty(‘foo_speak’))
console.log(foo.constructor.prototype.hasOwnProperty(‘bar_speak’))

In this example, when declaring foo, the class name is still included through foo = new Foo(‘foo, bar’), but for object this isn’t seen? I think i’m almost there just a bit lost on some bits.
Lastly, I gather that:
a) instance methods = can only be called by instances of a class.
(Instances of a class also happen to be objects now when defined using a constructor and a new operator?)
This means if i have x = 1, I can apply an instance method on x such as .valueOf.
b) static methods = can be called on classes. So If i had a variable that represents a group of objects such as an array, I would be able to apply a static method such as Object.assign?
I cannot thank you enough, but if you have read this thank you once again. I know its incredibly time consuming/ frustrating to keep responding to me but it is incredibly satisfying to understand something a bit better and I truly appreciate all the help you have given me.

In no particular order, I’ll try to go through (some) of your questions.
Prototype
A prototype is an object containing all the methods of a class or constructor function. Since all of JS exists in the same namespace, we can extend even the built in classes (though it is not a good idea in production code). Our class definitions and constructor functions just get piled on to the same code base. In other words, our custom objects are added to the prototype chain and get the same treatment as built-ins.
All classes have a prototype. We don’t have to create it. JavaScript does that when we define them. The thing to focus on is what our constructor is doing. It is creating a new object instance. We assign (or consume immediately) that instance and then are able to invoke its methods with that object as the execution context.
Segue to class methods…
Conveniently this topic has come up. A class definition is a different execution context than its instances. That’s why it didn’t have access to our extended method, above.
Static methods are executable by/on the class itself, or by instances, but which generally take arguments and do not draw on context data.



 board1774168228:

instance methods = can only be called by instances of a class.


Correct. That’s why they are called instance methods. They are owned by the instance, not the class, or the global object. Only an instance can call a method.
In the case of built in objects such as booleans, numbers, strings, objects and arrays we can see clearly demonstrated to the access to methods on each. Some have more methods than others. How many methods would we expect the Boolean class to have in its prototype? Yet numbers, strings, objects and arrays have a heap of them.
The top of the prototype chain is null. It has no attributes. How could it? Yet it is there, and it is an identifiable object.
null is what gets returned from prompt() when the user clicks Cancel or presses the Esc key on their keyboard. That means it is a returnable value, and therefore an object.
console.log(`${null || undefined}, ${typeof (null || undefined)}`)
console.log(`${null && undefined}, ${typeof (null && undefined)}`)

undefined undefined
null object


Thanks a lot for taking the time to type this all out, mtf! Really really helpful stuff.
I think I get it - so basically class/static methods can be invoked by classes or instances of that class. They’re non-specific, whereas instance methods are specific to instances only. Which is why .hasOwnProperty is an instance method, since you could never apply such a method to an entire class but only an instance. However, you could apply Object.entries to see all the properties inside a class, since classes have methods in them and methods are simply properties with functions.
So lastly, built-in functions are associated with .prototype so we never need to call .prototype when invoking any method, right?
Your image:
image1418×410 43.8 KB
And in your last image, you’re basically saying, undefined’s type is undefined whereas null is an object as shown by its typeof?
Thanks a lot btw!




 board1774168228:

undefined’s type is undefined whereas null is an object as shown by its typeof?


Exactly. undefined is not an object even while we consider it as the default return value of a function. It has no definition so cannot be prototyped. The Number equivalent would be zero which in maths is undefined. It’s one of the most common limits in calculus.
We rarely need to test for undefined, literally. It is falsy, which is enough to know.
const foo = function(x) {
    if (x > 0) return 'positive'
    if (x < 0) return 'negative'
}
console.log(foo(5))     // positive
console.log(foo(-5))    // negative
console.log(foo(0))     // undefined

if (foo(0)) {
    console.log('Not gonna happen.')
}

Thanks so much!!! 




 board1774168228:

you could apply Object.entries to see all the properties inside a class


Consider the following over-exaggeration:
class Foo {
    constructor(foo, bar) {
        this.foo = foo;
        this.bar = bar;
        this.foo_speak = Foo.foo_speak;
        this.bar_speak = Foo.bar_speak;
    }
    foo_speak () {
        console.log(`Aw, ${this.foo}!`)
    }
    bar_speak () {
        console.log(`Aw, ${this.bar}!`)
    }
}
console.log(Object.entries(Foo))
console.log(Object.entries(new Foo('a','b')))

Purely for illustration. Here’s the output…
[]
[ [ 'foo', 'a' ],
  [ 'bar', 'b' ],
  [ 'foo_speak', undefined ],
  [ 'bar_speak', undefined ] ]

Object.entries() does not list the methods of a class. The class definition has no entries that we can inspect with that method.

Ahh I see, haha, is that because Object.entries doesn’t list functions/constructors and thus, won’t list anything below or because my understanding is flawed?
Secondly, I was still just wondering (again unfortunately) why is it this.foo = foo;?
image1284×578 43 KB
Above you mentioned:
foo  is the formal parameter and has no value outside of the constructor. We need to assign it to the instance so it becomes a property value.  this.foo  is the new instance property.
But, surely we want to reassign the formal parameter to this.foo? Not this.foo to the formal parameter? or are they the same?
Thanks as always.




 board1774168228:

Say we’re a scientist studying Neutronium. Tell me our understanding is not flawed. It’s all baby-steps. The more we adapt that approach, and keep cycling back over prerequisite concepts and test ourselves against those paradigms the more progress we make going forward. Never think you don’t understand; but never also think that you do. That’s the seedling of curiosity.

52,Lodash project - question about declaring variables in loops?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
image2136×792 48.6 KB
If you declare the variable originalValue inside the loop using let originalValue = object[key]; instead of how its done in the image, the code doesn’t seem to work. Yet in other instances, you can declare variables in loops. How comes you can’t this time?
","

you can declare variables in loops

Yes, but it’s probably not what you’re thinking:
var list = [1,2]
for (const x of Array(5).keys()){
	list[x] = 3
	console.log(list);
};
/* output:
[ 3, 2 ]
[ 3, 3 ]
[ 3, 3, 3 ]
[ 3, 3, 3, 3 ]
[ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ]
*/
console.log(list[3])
// outputs: 3

In this is example if you just say list = x, it will change values in every iteration but it won’t retain them.
One more example:
var list = [1,2]
for (const x of Array(5).keys()){
	list[x] = x
	console.log(list);
};
/* output:
[ 0, 2 ]
[ 0, 1 ]
[ 0, 1, 2 ]
[ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
*/


Thanks a lot, I think I get what you’re saying. But in let originalValue = object[key] ; won’t the key be different each time as you work through the object so you’re not reassigning are you?
E.g. If I had invert{propertycats: pink, propertydog: blue} if would become:


let invertedObject = {};
let originalValue;
for (let key in object) {
originalValue = object[key]; //original value = pink
invertedObject[originalValue] = key; // inverted Object now has a property called pink with a value of propertycats.
}



let originalValue;
for (let key in object) {
originalValue = object[key]; //original value = blue
invertedObject[originalValue] = key; // inverted Object now has a property called blue with a value of propertydogs.
}
So my question is , why would they be reassigned when the property and values being added to invertedObject is changing? it’s not like invertedObject is reassigning the same property each time?
I don’t quite understand your examples as I haven’t learnt about const x of yet. 

Sorry, the for loop in my example is just generating a generic loop of numbers. Nothing fancier than that 
for (const x of Array(5).keys()){

	console.log(x);
};
/*output
0
1
2
3
4
*/


If you declare the variable originalValue inside the loop using let originalValue = object[key] ;

Notice in my examples I did’t declare list before-hand. You should play around with what happens if you do. My only idea in giving you these is that if you play around with these, you might be able to find the answer you’re looking for and more!
Whenever you’re unsure as to what a loop does, the best thing to do is to get your hands dirty and see what’s going on. You have a lot of changing variables key, originalValue, object[key], invertedObject[originalValue]. If you log them at each juncture: x is y now, x is z now etc… you will have a better idea of why it ‘works’ one way and not the other.

I finished every 17 steps of the project but unable to officially finish off the program by clicking on the “Next” button which seems to be frozen. I have basically finished off the whole program but basically stuck because Codecademy isn’t letting me to the last step so I am stuck in 93% in the program. Am I doing anything wrong?

Hey,
That sounds frustrating! Has happened to me before.
Some things you can try:

if it’s one of those self-check projects, you have to check every box to make sure you can click next. Sometimes these boxes magically uncheck (because of some hotkey interpretation)
if it’s the system validator checking every step: share what the last step is here and share your code in blockquotes so we can see if it’s meeting those conditions
try refreshing the page to see if it makes any difference (this works sometimes…)

54,Media Query Rules,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Hi!
I’m reviewing media queries in CSS and this lesson got me a bit confused.
The following rule is applied for screen sizes between 320 pixels and 480 pixels.
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
    /* ruleset for 320px - 480px */
}

However, the same code (which should apply the same rule), can be written separately but in the lesson the way it is explained how it works confused me a bit.
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) { 
    /* ruleset for >= 320px */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) { 
    /* ruleset for >= 480px */
}

“The first media will apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 320 pixels (…) The second media query will then apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 480 pixels”
So, in this case I understand both rules apply for screen sizes larger than the defined pixels dimensions, but in the one line @media code it says the rule applies for devices between the defined width sizes. Hence, they are not larger than what it’s stated.
It says both work the same way but how it is explained seems like they work differently.
Would appreciate your thoughts! Thanks.
","
Try using your browser features to visualize how the dimensions work. Once you open up the inspect element, you can actually tinker with the dimensions explicitly (see screenshots below). The media min-max width concept is easier to get once you do this, as you can see the main ways people will see your page (don’t neglect to try the rotated phones and tablets!).
The way I personally got comfortable with this was just having a page whose layout I had already drawn on paper (with mobile versions as well) – and then trying to make it look exactly like I wanted for each possibility (phone, rotated tablet, etc.). Sometimes I would only get 1 new one done in a day (or less!), but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth(er) sailing .
Depending on how you structure your layout, sometimes there are grey areas where if a browser gets resized or rotated, everything falls apart, so you can add small queries to target those instances as well.
I personally like working with Firefox for css, but Chrome should give you a lot of tools too.


Hopefully this helps!

I haven’t understood the code please, explain it.Explain it in such a way that I barely know anything about it.

Hi thanks for sharing!
Whenever I run into code that I want to understand, I try to go through a checklist of sorts:


Visualize Draw a diagram on paper of the components (can be in pseudocode)

Identify Highlight techniques I’m unfamiliar with (loops, conditionals, imported libraries, methods)… Then do a quick search so that I at least understand their purpose (even just a small understanding)

Test Try to run some test through the code. If i have a lot of time, I always feel paper helps me digest what’s happening better. If i don’t have time, I will print formatted strings everywhere around a portion of the code to just be able to track how the variables and functions are working together.

Example of useful strings
greeting = ""Hello, good morning""
print(""the greeting is: "" + greeting)
#prints: the greeting is: Hello, good morning

test_num = 5
print(""the test number is: "" + (str)test_num)
#prints: the test number is: 5
#note you need to put str() in front of non-string variables for them to print



Ask Finally, if there is something after all that that I still don’t understand, I can have a question that is super specific to my problem, like:
Why does the following code give me an error?

test_num = 5
print(""the test number is: "" + test_num)
# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not ""int"") to str

Enjoy The main takeaway is that this process is very common to get a better understanding of programming. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but as you get used to it you may find that you enjoy breaking the code apart to see what it does!

Hi, Welcome to the forums.
The easiest way probably, is to create a blank JavaScript file and add some code, for example:

When I press F5 on my Windows computer in VS Code, I keep getting an error message pop-up:
“Cannot find runtime ‘node’ on PATH. Is ‘node’ installed?”
It then gives me the option to “open launch.json”
I don’t know what that means. I’ve clicked that option and it opens up something new but I have no idea what it is.

57,What else does the LinearRegression function provide?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what else does the LinearRegression function provide?
Answer
There are a few other things that the LinearRegression function provides and lets us do.
When creating a LinearRegression model, you can choose to determine whether it should calculate any intercept for the model, by setting the fit_intercept parameter to True or False. If you choose not to calculate any intercept for the model, it will except that the data is already centered. In addition, you can also set other parameters such as normalize, copy_X and n_jobs.
In addition, you can obtain all the parameters of the model’s estimator using the get_params() method, and, you can use the score() method to obtain the R^2 score, which is a value telling how close the data is to the regression line.
To see a full list of all you can do with the LinearRegression function, with more details on each method and parameter, you can also check out the documentation.
","
For anyone who may have been puzzled by the wording regarding fit_intercept, here is the explanation from the documentation

fit_intercept  : boolean, optional, default True
whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

Link: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression

Just curious
The  .fit()  method gives the model two variables that are useful to us:

the  line_fitter.coef_ , which contains the slope
the  line_fitter.intercept_ , which contains the intercept

Is there any point to print these figures out?
I tried to print it but was unable to find the variables

Hi,
Would it be possible to flip the image? I think it’s a typo in the book. When the book says “you have to check log n elements” it really means that. So the example log 8 == 3 should mean that with 8 elements the code runs a max of 3 times in the worst case.  Log 1024 == 10 means with 1,024 elements you have to run a max of 10 times.

Hi,
No matter how many times I’ve done for loops, there’s something comforting about just seeing i printed out and printed out in a format that helps me. In this case you’ll also probably also want to not only print i, but print lst1[i] and lst2[-1] to see what you’re working with.
If you’re not familiar, formatted string statements are great to work with. One way to write them is
print(""The value of i is: {0}"".format(i))

Hi there,
Whenever you execute an SQL statement you need to close your statement by semi-colon (;), put semi-colon on your statement and I think you would be fine.

@kabirjain8574170360,
In addition to adding a semicolon as @betizazualemu2392118 mentioned, you also need to open or create a database file before trying out any queries. As the prompt tells you, use .open FILENAME to open a database.  If the file is not located in the same folder as your sqlite3.exe, then you will need to use .open PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE/FILENAME.db or navigate to the correct folder using SQLite’s .cd command.
Another, more beginner-friendly option is to download and use DB Browser for SQLite.

Thanks, I ensured that

Semicolon is put after SQL statements
‘usgs.sqlite’ file is within the same folder. Probably it requires a tables name with Select and .open command before the statement.

Have switched to DB browser. It is quite user-friendly and has made the experience very smooth.

Don’t lose hope! Sometimes it simply takes a little for things to ‘click’, particularly with different ideas.
I would start out by writing out on paper in very general terms (or voice memos could work too!):
Here are some thoughts I ask myself when dealing with new, daunting material:

What is (node js), what is it for?
What are some of of the common techniques it uses to achieve those aims?
Of those, which do you feel most/least uncomfortable about?
One day, pick 1 of those uncomfortable ideas and research about it (book, forums, youtube, codecademy)
Once you become more familiar with your ‘difficulty’, try to see if you can combine that difficulty with ideas you are more comfortable with, you can even do it briefly on a conceptual level on paper

If you attack the little difficulties first, you will become more familiar with more specific issues… and to have specificity over something is very powerful (because then you know what you can concentrate your efforts on and bring others to help).
All of this of course, takes time and energy, so do it when you do have good energy to tackle something even if it’s only 20 minutes. This forum can also help out, so don’t be afraid to ask the tiniest questions! Even the outline of the plan to better understand node can be shared for feedback, and you’d be surprised how helpful that can be.
I have met and worked with many incredibly talented people in my life. But I don’t know any that tackle all their worst difficulties every day of every week. It’s ok to pick your battles starting small.

return this._courses[courseName].push(dish);
                                                             
TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined

That should be a good clue. Consider, what value is this._courses[courseName] giving you? Try console.log on that value before the return line to get a better idea.

Thanks for responding. It says undefined when I console.log(this._courses[courseName]), so I reckon something is wrong in that its not recognising the this._courses[courseName] as being equal to the arrays underneath _courses.
Still can’t figure it out though 

Took a look at the code. The .push() error for undefined is because… well, nothing is defined! Pay attention to typos.
You have:
let menu = {
 _courses: {
   appetizers: [],
   mains: [],
   desserts: []
   },

but when you add dishes you have:
menu.addDishToCourse('appetizer', 'Cutlets', 0.3);
menu.addDishToCourse('main', 'Biryani', 4);

Did you spot the difference?

this._courses.appetizers throws this TypeError: Cannot read property 'appetizers' of undefined
So it’s helpful to go down the rabbit hole of checking that all your parameters are logging as you want them to be logging. It may seem tedious, but it’s a common process that’ll make you stronger as a programmer.

This is embarrassing…thanks so much man! I made a few mistakes and this was probably the biggest one. Thanks!

Thanks so much once again bro, you are correct I did what you said and finally found the error!

Since the program does not use the getters or setters we don’t see the circular reference error.

Greetings!
I’ve just run into this wonderful article codecademy offers on bugs in the web dev path:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/webdev-intermediate-javascript/modules/errors-and-error-handling/articles/thinking-about-errors-in-your-code-differently
I’ve gone through the entire Codecademy CS Path and about 30% of both the web dev and data science one and really the mindset towards tackling errors was not really mentioned in any overt way as clearly as it was in this article. I recommend it to all my fellow colleagues!

67,Python3 - Global Variables - Use or Avoid?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Hi all,
So I have worked my way through the Python ‘Physics Class’ project on the Comp. Science track.
In the project you create some functions and then use said functions later in another function. The functions I am posting in relation to are the get_force() & get_work() functions. My question is around the use of global variables. In my get_work() function I called a variable that only existed in the get_force() function:

def get_force():
global n_force      # Made n_force global as it is used in get_work() function
train_mass = int(input(""What is the train’s mass in kg? ""))   # Inputs make more flexible
train_acceleration = int(input(""What is the train’s acceleration? ""))
n_force = train_mass*train_acceleration
print(“The GE train supplies "" + str(n_force) + "" Newtons of force.”)
return n_force
def get_work():
get_force()         # Calls the get_force() function to eliminate repetition
n_distance = int(input(""What is the distance of travel? ""))
n_work = n_force * n_distance   # Calls the global variable - n_force
print(“The GE train does "" + str(n_work) + "" Joules of work over "" + str(n_distance) + "" metres.”)
get_work()

Is it best to avoid using global variables in the above way? If so, can I ask why? Is there some security issue with it or possibly breaks code when you work on more complex tasks?

Hi there, welcome to the forums. 



 jcmiles:

Is it best to avoid using global variables in the above way?


Yeah, I’d say that’s not a great use of global variables. If there’s a genuine need for some value to be available throughout the program, then a global variable is fine. In your case, it’s unnecessary.
The whole reason that you’ve made n_force a global variable is because you want to use it in your get_work function, right?
You’ve gone to the effort of writing a function, get_force, which calculates the force and returns that value to the caller. We can just as easily do the following to the same effect, and avoid introducing an unnecessary global:
def get_force():
    # note the lack of the global variable...
    train_mass = int(input(""What is the train’s mass in kg? ""))
    train_acceleration = int(input(""What is the train’s acceleration? ""))
    n_force = train_mass*train_acceleration
    print(""The GE train supplies "" + str(n_force) + "" Newtons of force."")
    return n_force # we can now get a value for n_force whenever we want by calling get_force

def get_work():
    n_force = get_force() # get a value for n_force - reuse variable name, thanks to scoping
    n_distance = int(input(""What is the distance of travel? ""))
    n_work = n_force * n_distance # this line unchanged, still works. :)
    print(""The GE train does "" + str(n_work) + "" Joules of work over "" + str(n_distance) + "" metres."")
    return n_work

get_work()

You’ve correctly understood that the functions represent an opportunity to avoid repeating ourselves when we need to do a specific task, but not the best way to get information from one function to another. 

Much appreciated for your reply! It seems so simple now you’ve shown me aha.

No worries. You were most of the way there, I think you were just missing the last little bit of how to get the result of get_force into your get_work function. 
If you get stuck with anything else, let us know. 

Check this threat for more depth in the issue (the title is misleading, but the thread is good!)

68,A-Frame Solar System: Audio not working,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Hello Everyone!!
While getting some more effort into the A-Frame Solar System project, I got it to work on GitHub through its personal website function:
It’s up on https://snowprimate.github.io/
Everything is working, just the audio I’ve got into it doesn’t seem to play! I’d like to know if anyone could figure it out, reading A-Frame’s documentations seems like I’m doing everything right!

@lucasvinzon looks awesome!
in the <audio> element’s 's autoplay attribute, there should be a closing double quote after true.
also btw, that project just got updated so make sure to check out the new version. and more content coming next week!
and if you keep going and create your own solar system, i’m more than happy to include the solution in the project.

Hi Sam, welcome to the forums!
What did you join the two tables on? I’m assuming the IDs(?) I’m also assuming that the IDs are the same in both tables, but, one is a PRIMARY KEY and the other is a FOREIGN KEY.

ex: SELECT * FROM classes JOIN students ON classes.id = students.class_id;
Can you please post a snippet of your code & a few rows of the output? Also, what module or lesson is this?

I figured it out…I think I just needed to talk it out…
thank you…

70,KNN classification,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Today, I was extremely frustrated with codecademy. One of the best things about learning Machine learning and other languages in this amazing platform is how much background info it provides to the user and helps understand the algorithm before writing the piece of code. While doing this lesson on Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors, I was recreating the same code om my own system as well, so that I can follow through on my system and help me build the logic, but the files required were missing. Why maintain that much of secrecy? I did some courses on pandas, and the files required were available on the navigator which I could copy, paste, and use it on my system. I tried so many things to get those files and scripts required like used glob module and with open file and like that, but of no avail. I would be very grateful what other users think about that and would be great if anyone from the codecademy responds. Thanks.

71,"Having trouble understanding ""elif statement""","Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Hello Everyone,
I’m learning Python for the first time and am having trouble fully grasping the concept/purpose of  the “elif” statement.
Can anyone explain how the statement functions with the if statement?
Thanks.
","
An elif (else if) statement can only follow an if statement. They can be chained together to control program flow.
We start with the condition of the if statement being checked. If it evaluates to True the specific code block related to it is executed. It then shortcuts any of the following elif and else statements, they are completely ignored.
Should it evaluate to False the following elif statement is checked. If that evaluates to True then it executes the code block attached to the elif statement and shortcuts any further elif or else statements. If it evaluates to False the chain moves onto the next expression and evalutes it.
So you have a chain of expressions that are evaluated one by one. If any single one evaluates to True its code block is executed and the rest of the chain is skipped.
An else statement can be added to the end of this chain and if each and every preceding statement evalutes to False then the code block associated with it is executed.
In the example below x is equal to integer 6. We first check the if statement. Is x less than zero? No it is is not. So we start moving down the chain. Is it between 0 and 5 inclusive, no. So we move to the second elif statement. That one is also False. So we move to the third elif statement. Is x grteater than 5 but less than or equal to 10. Yes.
We execute the code block associated with that elif: print(“third elif statement”). Since it evaluted to True we skip any further elif and else statements in the code entirely. Even the expressions aren’t executed.
x = 6

if x < 0:
    # if x is less than zero, do this...
    print(""first if statement"")
elif 0 <= x <= 5:
    # if x is greater than or equal to zero but less than or equal to 5, do...
    print(""first elif statement"")
elif 0 <= x <= 5:
    # if x is greater than or equal to zero but less than or equal to 5, do...
    print(""second elif statement"")
    # note that this one will never execute because the condition will be met
    # in the first elif statement.
elif 5 < x <= 10:
    # if x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10 do...
    print(""third elif statement"")
elif x == 12:
   # else if x is equal to twelve
    print(""fourth elif statement"")
else:
    # if no other condition is met then do this...
    print(""all ELSE is False"")

Try it with a few different values and see if you can get each of the print statements to execute (exlcuding the second elif statement unless you’re feeling highly adventurous).

@tgrtim explained it wonderfully.
A personal analogy I think of is when you are giving instructions to someone: get me a cheese sandwich from the store. They’ll reply what if they don’t have? And if they don’t have that? And if they don’t have anything?

order = cheese_sandwich
if order not in menu:
   order = ham
elif order not in menu:
   order = chips
else:
   cry()


elif is not a statement, it’s an optional part of an if-statement, same with else.
An if-statement amounts to jumps to different parts of the code based on conditions, elif is just more of the same thing.

In a flow chart we use a rhombus (think ball diamond) to indicate conditional branching. The simplest form is if x.
if condition:
    # follow this branch
# end of if
# proceed from here

The above will follow the branch only when condition evaluates to True, as in, is truthy. Flow will continue down the code to the next statement, which will occur regardless of the outcome of if.
if dark:
    dim screen
print check_brightness

Above in pseudo-code form we see that the `check_brightness’ step is taken whether we dim the screen or not.
That is the simplest form of an if statement.

Hello @jagmeetsond589256300. My advice is to take things slowly, and to revisit lessons as many times as you need. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Also, throughout your journey, set yourself mini challenges that use what you’ve just learnt. If you need a compiler, you can use repl-be it if you need to test code or start a project. Codewars is also a good place to find ready-made challenges.
There are also some good resources, from the Python docs(docs) to Geeks for Geeks(website with good information in it), which has multiple languages, to these forums to Stack Overflow(another set of forums). There are of course many other useful websites/resources, theses are just the ones that spring to my mind as useful and/or easy to understand.
I hope this helps!

Hello world!
I just finished the course ‘Make a Website’, which was really fun and due to which I now want to build my own website.

Download the vscode extension called Live Preview and you’ll be able to code and see the result of your code in real time for HTML/CSS/JS

You can also just open the .html files directly from your PC and see the results in any browser. 
(It’s slightly more involved if you’re working with something like PHP, or anything which needs a server to do the processing.)

Just open the page in your browser from your pc, then size it so that it is side by side with where you are typing, then just be refreshing the page to see whatever new function you added to your page.

Hi there, welcome to the forums.
One suggestion would be Python, because it’s easy to pick up but also thanks to things like CircuitPython it can be applied to a variety of uses.
(I offer CircuitPython as an example, as it’s designed to allow you to use Python to program microcontrollers…)

Python is a very good one to learn. As @thepitycoder said, it can be used in a very wide range. Knowledge of Python will also allow you to use your computer to a fuller extent, by writing your own programs to assist you, or creating a bot like Alexa to run your computer when you are away. With the import of modules, which are add-ons you can customize GUI’s, process data, or even make games.
Another good thing to learn is web developement, mainly HTML CSS and JavaScript.
HTML and CSS are easy to learn and can be used for more than just the web, such as visual documents.
Deciding what you want to learn how to do will greatly effect which language you want to use. And after trying a few languages, you may develop a like for a particular one and specialize in that. 

I suggest you learn HTML because it is the basis for many other languages. It is easy and very fun to learn.

79,What do I need to start working with machine learning?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Question
This lesson, provided an introduction to machine learning. What do I need to get started working with machine learning?
Answer
To get started working with machine learning, you only need a few things.
First, you will need a language to write your machine learning code in, and an editor. Python is probably the most accessible and easy to use, as well as one of the most powerful languages for machine learning. To get Python, we suggest downloading Anaconda, which is a package manager for Python that includes Python and many useful packages. It also comes with Jupyter Notebook, an application that runs on your browser, and lets you edit and run code directly in the browser.
Once you’ve installed Python, you would need to install the required packages for machine learning, if not already included. These include sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib.
Once you have all that, you’re ready to get started! You can obtain datasets for testing out your models from online resources like Kaggle.com, or you can even create your own datasets.
","
Question : Is it possible to follow the exercices in the ML Path using Colab?
Thanks,
H

You can do it but you would need to then upload the dataset to Colab after you download it on your machine.

For this course, should I download the Python 2.7 or 3.7 IDE? Is it worthwhile having both for other courses and when I write my own programs?

","
When an image is smaller than the container it’s forming the background of, it by default gets tiled in all directions. You have a few options depending on what you want to do.
If you just want it to be the single background on its own filling the container, then you need to define the image width and height to be the same as the container. Or else if you want it smaller, but not repeating you can add the property background-repeat: no-repeat. You can find more on this property here.

Thanks Adam. I will try that

background-size may also be a CSS property that would be useful, in this instance.

83,What do we use to work with databases?,"Get Help,General Programming",,14,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what do we use to work with databases?
Answer
To work with databases, we use software known as database management systems, or DBMS for short. Database management systems let us do very useful things such as create and manipulate database tables, by writing and running code in the form of queries or statements. For an example, the following query will return all the rows from a database,
SELECT * 
FROM table;

Some of the most popular and well-known database management systems are SQLite which is used in the courses on Codecademy, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

It is showing all 1s .

image.png1366×768 87.4 KB

Why the code has not selected 1 column in case of this? Or Is there any way we can limit the column and unlimited rows?

You select individual columns by their name. For example , if you wanted only the user_id column, you could:
SELECT user_id
FROM browse;

Leaving out the LIMIT clause would return all 2,352 user id’s in a single column.

SELECT 1
FROM browse;
They can limit the column (SELECT 1 - limit columns have value = 1) and unlimit rows.

We use data bases because is a way to have the data organized.  In this sense then is necessary a management system to administrate  the data so people develop a language to administrate de organized data in a databases.

Select 1 from (table_name) => will return a column named [1] and having value = 1 for the number of rows in the table you specified in (table_name).
if you want to only select first column in your table use :
SELECT [Column_name] FROM [TableName]

Does this course have prerequisites please?

In my opinion that we use  SQL to work with databases

The thing is, looking at the schema there wasn’t a column named 1. Is it that integer selections will override the logic of the database and generate it’s own table?

No, it doesn’t. If you are new to coding, I can recommend starting with Code Foundations career path.  I started with it😉. It helped me to decide what to learn🥳.

We use a data management systems such as a SQL, Excel or Google Sheets to sift through data and draw conclusions based on the problem we’re attempting to solve, or information we’re attempting to string together to tell a cohesive story.

if i want to select 2 column, for example user_id and browse_date
how do i incorporate into Select function?

You could try:

87,When does convergence happen?,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, describing step 4 of K-Means clustering, when does convergence happen?
Answer
Convergence happens when the positions of all the centroids are no longer updated, meaning that they must have converged on some clusters.
We do this in our code by calculating the change in distance for each centroid from its previous position and storing these values inside of an array, called errors. When all the values in this array become 0, there has been convergence.
","
Unfortunately,  the exercise suggests to use while error.all() != 0 as the loop condition. However, this will stop the loop as soon as any of the values in error becomes zero, instead of all of them.:
>>> import numpy as np 
>>> error = np.array([1,0,1])
>>> error.all() != 0
False

Probably a better terminating condition would be while error.any() != 0.

Agree, while error.any() != 0 would be the correct conditional statement in this case.

Nice suggestion, error.all() != 0 will stop  even if 1 error is zero.

Totally agree !!! 

Traceback (most recent call last):
File “script.py”, line 67, in

Why is this error popping up and what do I do to get rid of it?

Yeah, it’s still more than worth learning how to do web-based development.

“We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals”. - Quarry worker’s creed (from the Pragmatic Programmer)
A suggestion that helps me (I have to study it about 6+hours plus a day) is that jargon is your worst enemy. It literally alienates you from the reality of what you’re doing. Take the time to understand words and give them a context that you find exciting or meaningful. In high school I’ll be honest SQL was the worst for me, but now that I’m relearning it’s not so bad, because let my mind imagine structures and stories as to what it can add up to.
Also, try to sprinkle different aspects here and there for variety (so a little SQL one day, Python the other etc.
But definitely don’t try forcing the issue, I ended up hating coding for the longest time but I think personally it was just due to my mindset being very rigid.

Thanks! I think I’ll try something else for awhile.

Thank you! I will definitely try to get some more variety.

Also consider changing your learning style. Sometimes I voice memo myself little notes and just listen back later. Then when I come back and have to type out the exercises, it comes out like a flash.
Everybody learns different, it’s worth trying out different methods too if you’re curious.

zisto, start from the point of your interests.  What interests you in life?  Write down in this thread at least 3 things you really like in life.

I really like video games, business, and politics.

So if you had to realize those through coding what would you build?
You have to eventually get specific with games, business, and politics.  Narrow it down to smaller points of interest.  Map them out as clouds on paper with connecting lines of interest.  Politics --> cable TV commentary --> top TV commentators ----> truth versus non-truth —> shaping of an electorate —> get out the vote —> are voting rights all we really have —> countries without voting rights —> dictatorships in Southeast Asia ----> southeast Asian tropical fruit ----> I really like mangos ----> website on all the types of mangos in the world and recipes for smoothies …
From there, within the world of programming we build websites (communicate a view, gather other peoples’ opinions, graph results).  We build programs (utilities to help other people, lists of things like resources, books, movies, nearest hospitals within a 1-mile radius).  We create databases (all the vegetarian restaurants and their menus, all the speeches of the Dalai Lama, library collections of books or all Jazz recordings by cool era jazz players).
So, to fire up your interest in coding, you have to use what you like as the foundation.

this is good, thank you

94,What other parameters can we pass into the KMeans method?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what other parameters can we pass into the KMeans method?
Answer
There are several other parameters that you can provide to the KMeans method. Some of them are as follows.
You can utilize the init parameter, which determines how the initial clusters are placed in step 1 of the algorithm. One of the values you can provide for this parameter is “k-means++”, which is an optimization of the algorithm by choosing initial cluster centers in a smart way to speed up convergence.
You can also provide a max_iter parameter, which is the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm for each run. By default, this value is 300.
Another parameter you can utilize is n_init which sets the number of times the K-Means clustering algorithm is run, each time with different initial centroids. By default, the algorithm will run 10 times. The best result of all the runs of the algorithm is chosen and used as the final output.
For more parameters available, you can check out the documentation at scikit-learn’s site, under the sklearn.cluster.KMeans method.
","
Here in this exercise we are told that the predict method computes the centroids and also guesses the labels for the data that is given to it as input.Does that mean that every time we input new data in predict method the centroid will be calculated according to that data , but this is wrong because we are trying to predict the label of a new iris flower based on the clusters that we made from previously collected data.
Can someone please help?
"
95,What else does Pandas let us do?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what else does Pandas let us do?
Answer
Pandas provides a lot of useful features and functionality to work with data.
One of the most useful features of Pandas is that it provides objects known as Dataframes, which are very similar to 2D arrays of data or database tables. Dataframes are a collection of objects named “Series”, which are individual columns.
With Pandas and its dataframes, you can perform useful functions. As shown in the exercise, you can easily load data from a CSV file and store it as a variable in the form of a dataframe. You can also write to and create new files just as easily.
In addition, you can modify the shape of these dataframes by pivoting, add or remove columns from a dataframe, or merge different dataframes together.
Furthermore, you can utilize some of built-in methods that dataframes provide, such as the df.mean() methord, which will return the mean value of all the columns, or df.max(), which will return the highest value of each column of the dataframe.
Because of these reasons, and many others, Pandas can be a very indispensable tool for data analysts.
","
I’m curious as to how this offers greater capabilities then say excel spreadsheets. Some of the functions mentioned can be preformed in spreadsheets, how do Pandas provide greater value than the abilities that spreadsheets have? Is their an increased number of functions that can be performed? Do Pandas and Dataframes provide greater flexibility in the ability to merge data and append data?

The answer is essentially yes to all your questions! Pandas allows for easier manipulation, and analysis of datasets that could otherwise be pretty tedious to do in a single csv file. Data analysis within a single CSV file is useful and more efficient under certain settings (i.e. a short and relatively clean data set), but Pandas allows for merging of various CSV (and non CSV file) data sets, clean them up together and do a grander analysis of these combined data sets. This would be very time consuming to do on a single Excel sheet.
This only scratches the surface and there are various other utilities when pandas is combined with the functions of other python libraries.
Hope this somewhat answers your question!

Hi! I am a bit confused as to how these initial chapters are to be learned. I am absolutely new to this and don’t understand why the codes have not been introduced before we are asked to run them. For the SQL and Python intros, I individually researched each code on Google and understood them, but the one about Panda is not clear to me as to what exactly is being done here. What is the best way to navigate and learn through the data science path?

Hi, I’m new too and only have a little familiarity with python before taking this course. But essentially, Pandas is a Python Library. Python libraries are basically a collection of functions and methods that you can essentially call upon without having to write in as code. Pandas specifically gives your code the ability to work with data in a number of ways, in the example of this task it was creating a Data-frames, which is essentially like a 2D database table, the one we got to the right of the screen with columns etc.
I recommend reading the background to the left of the screen thoroughly, and any concepts and ideas you struggle to grasp, keep them in the back of your mind and ask them here after running the program or if you can’t solve the bug.
The reason Pandas was brought up in relation to SQL is because, while Pandas is a library belonging to the Python Programming Language, the Pandas library is powerful as it can be used in Python to fulfil a lot of the functions programmers would otherwise rely on SQL to do, which in my opinion highlights the versatility Python but Pandas was added for the fact it can be used to fulfil a good amount of functions SQL is used for.
Also in regards to the program you import the pandas library as “pd” so that you can call on the library throughout the coding process. First comment on here xD, bear in mind I’m learning too and can’t code so take what I said with a grain of salt. But I hope this helps  .

96,Confused about learning how to learn,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
I just started to learn about programming, specifically javascript and web dev. And as a best practice, I picked up a great web development course that taps into Javascript fundamentals as well as some hands-on applications.
However, I found numerous websites and online academies -like this one- that offer the same (even better, sometimes more different) quality material (for free), so my only question is how to deal with this state of confusion of to having to choose from multiple programs/coding curriculums? is it more logical to stick to only one thing? or, skim through all the programs while learning from the course?
Thanks! I hope it makes sense.

Hello @abdelilahazzouzi3318!! Welcome to the Codecademy community!! 
Everyone learns differently so throughout your coding experience you will find what works best for you.
When it comes to the many different coding sites, I found it best to stick to just one when you are first starting so you don’t get overloaded with many different concepts at once. I would pick a site that you like and start there.
For me I found CC to be my favorite with the way their learning environment works.
Once you understand the basic concepts you may find it easier to bounce back and forth, and start looking into the official documentation for the language you are using.

As for choosing a language, that depends on what you are wanting to learn to do.
If you want to build websites than HTML and CSS are a good place to start, followed by JavaScript.
Were as if you want to design apps you may want to learn something like Python, C++, or JavaScript.
The best thing to do would probably to decide what you want to learn how to do, and find out which language would be best for you to learn.




 abdelilahazzouzi3318:

is it more logical to stick to only one thing? or, skim through all the programs while learning from the course?


For me I found it easiest to start with one language and focus on that until I understood the basics of how it worked, and then I could bounce back and forth between different courses.
It again comes down to how you learn, some people can focus on multiple things at once, were as others may get confused and start mixing up concepts.

97,What is multinomial naive Bayes?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In this lesson we use scikit-learn's MultinomialNB class to implement a naive Bayes classifier. What is multinomial naive Bayes? Why isn’t the class simply called NaiveBayes?
Answer
The word multinomial in MultinomialNB refers to the probability distribution underlying our application. To be more explicit, remember that we must have an idea of how the probabilities for our application are computed (whether everything is equally likely, a uniform distribution, or our data is normally distributed, or something else).
Naive Bayes does not tell us how to choose this underlying distribution; it provides us with an equation to use once we have worked out how to compute the probabilities. So naive Bayes is a very general term and we could use different classes based on the different distributions we decide are appropriate for our application. For example, sklearn.naive_bayes provides the following variants of naive Bayes, where the difference is in the underlying probability distribution

BernoulliNB
GaussianNB
MultinomialNB
ComplementNB

This is why we don’t simply call the class NaiveBayes – the underlying distribution is important.
","
The predict_proba() method gives us the probabilities of the datapoint having either label. In practice (as in, how it’s done in industry or in academic research) would we incorporate something like an ‘ambiguous’ label if neither probability meets a confidence threshold?

98,How does changing the mean and standard deviation affect descriptive and inferential statistics?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how does changing the mean and standard deviation affect descriptive and inferential statistics?
Answer
Changing the mean and standard deviation values will have a direct effect on descriptive statistics, since it deals with describing the dataset itself, without making any other inferences or conclusions about it. If we change the mean or standard deviation, descriptive statistics will just describe the updated dataset, which might have drastically different results than before.
However, changing the mean and standard deviation will usually not have as big an impact on inferential statistics as it will on descriptive statistics. This is because inferential statistics is based on inferences and conclusions about the larger population, so it is possible that the results and conclusions remain the same, or similar, even after we change the mean and standard deviation values.
","
This ‘Answer’ is not very correct. If you change the mean or the standard deviation, effectively it means the datasets are changed, to arrive at such results. Therefore, descriptive and inferential results are also altered.  We infer from datasets.

Anything need to be changed. Just need to collect good (reliable) data and after that, statistics are just applied math. It summarizes Garbage in, garbage out.
"
99,How do we determine how to perform smoothing in the case of naive Bayes?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
Here we decide that adding 1 to the numerator and N, the number of unique words in our dataset, to the denominator is what needs to be done to accomplish “smoothing”. How is this determined?
Answer
Let’s first recall that smoothing is a response to the issue where a review contains a word which is not contained in our dataset. For example, say that the review is “This crib is groovy” and we want to judge whether it is a positive review. Naive Bayes says that we should compute P(review | positive) like this

P(""This"" | positive) * P(""crib"" | positive) * P(""is"" | positive) * P(""groovy"" | positive)

If the word “groovy” is nowhere to be found in our dataset, then P(""groovy"" | positive) = 0 and so P(""This crib is groovy"" | positive) = 0. We don’t want this. What smoothing allows us to do is give a baseline, non-zero, default value for such words. What is a reasonable value? The smoothing presented here makes the assumption that a reasonable value is 1/N where N is the number of unique words in our dataset. You can think of this as meaning that this unmatched word can have the meaning of any of the given words and so contributes proportionally to any of the potential classifications, for us positive and negative.
","
But here when there is a new unique word or typo that is present in a review then the baseline would be 1/(N+total_pos) , not 1/N. Can please someone explain this?

In practice (e.g. in a business or research project where we care a lot about catching every word in a text we’re trying to classify), surely we can use tools like regex to detect the correct spelling as well as common misspellings? How might such “dictionaries of misspellings” be incorporated?

it’s better display the progress and certificate like another programme learning apps, just a suggestion, thanks for your reply~

102,Redirecting Input and Output - wc,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
I am studying bash commands in the Web Development path. I am currently doing this project and point 4 reads like this:
Redirect  plants.txt  as standard input to the wordcount command. Use the  -l  option on the wordcount command.
I’d have done something like this (which doesn’t work):
cat plants.txt | wc -l
Instead, the suggested solution is this:
wc -l < plants.txt
Can anyone please help me understand why the suggested solution works, while mine doesn’t?
Thank you in advance.
","
Why the suggested solution works:
wc -l < plants.txt pushes the contents of plants.txt into wc -l (note the direction of the angle bracket).  By default, the output of wc -l will run in the terminal, solving this exercise.
Why your solution doesn’t work:
I’m not sure.  I ran a series of tests of both commands offline on the same file, and both had the same output (regardless of the contents of plants.txt).  Without reading the project (which I do not have access to), I can’t say for sure, but I’d guess it’s Codecademy wanting something done in a particular way to demonstrate understanding of a concept it’s trying to teach.
The other thought I had was that the suggested solution possibly runs more efficiently than yours? Certainly it appears (at least to me) to be more readable.

< is still quite unclear to me to be honest, it’s like… I thought of it just like an alternative to >, but probably I am not right there.
Thank you for your answer pal! =)

103,What is scikit-learn's CountVectorizer object?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
We learn here that in order to use scikit-learn for naive Bayes, we must use the CountVectorizer object. What is this object and how does it differ from the method we used to implement naive Bayes with Python’s Counter object?
Answer
When we implemented naive Bayes with the Counter data structure, we needed to first prepare the text by dividing the positive and negative reviews into a list of unique words. We then pass this prepared list to the Counter data structure. Scikit-learn enables us to do both these processes in one step with the CountVectorizer object. It implements both tokenization (that is, diving our text documents unique words or tokens) and occurrence counting in a single class. In this way, it makes our work easier.
","
Why did I received nulls in the resulting array after application .transform method on the same data as to used to fit?
printing .transform result (array where each element is the count of times the word from .transform(data) appears in .fit(data)
counter = CountVectorizer()
counter.fit(neg_list + pos_list)
training_counts = counter.transform(neg_list + pos_list)
print(training_counts.toarray())

I expect that each element will be >= 1, since .transform(data) has been built on  .fit(data). This means that each word from .transform(data) should appear in .fit(data) at least 1 times.
But it gives me many nulls:
[[0 0 1 ... 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 ... 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 ... 3 0 0]
 ...
 [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]

106,Lost in Warby Parker Exercise,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
I’ve been working through this module for hours. Seriously, HOURS!  So I can use a hand on this. I tried using the “Hint,” but I don’t even understand that.
The instructions where I am say:
Use a  LEFT JOIN  to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).
I know I was off in where my code is. I was just trying to connect things. My thinking was here:


gist.github.com


https://gist.github.com/codecademydev/24900446f0590819937a8a5f4cc3d1b8
project.sqlite
 SELECT *
 FROM home_try_on
 LEFT JOIN purchase 
 ON home_try_on.b = purchase.a
 LEFT JOIN 
 LIMIT 10;







The hint though, threw me a curve ball. Here’s what it says:
SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id,
h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS ‘is_home_try_on’,
h.number_of_pairs,
p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS ‘is_purchase’
FROM quiz q
LEFT JOIN home_try_on h
ON q.user_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase p
ON p.user_id = q.user_id
LIMIT 10;
Here’s my issue right now: I have no idea how we got to letters h, p, q, or how they came up with those. I thought maybe the letters matched up with where the letters were on each of the three tables, but the letters don’t match. I know there’s something I’m doing wrong, I just don’t know what it is.

Please help. Send brain.
UPDATE:
I think I figured it out. The query defines an alias/variable for each table (i.e. “FROM quiz q” so that quiz=q) and then uses those same variables in the SELECT section. I’m not sure if I had seen this in a previous exercise, but I think that’s what I couldn’t figure out. I’ll leave this question here for a  while to see if anyone has comments or corrections.

You won’t like this suggestion, but think of it…

Lower one’s expectations to the point where you are not failing.

This is an indication of competency. Set the bar at the bottom, and only raise it when you are successful with a given concept, or group of concepts in a course unit. Review once the unit is complete, and if you do not pass the quiz, go back through the unit, again. Be sure to track down the documentation for every new concept.
Cover the same type of material repeatedly until it comes naturally. When you can think in code, you’re learning the nouns and verbs and grammar. That means learning all the various ways it can used. Play with the code and don’t be in hurry to jet off to the next unit.

Thanks a lot. I like the suggestion to lower my expectations  but the problem is I am not sure how low should I go, what is the benchmark. LOL  When in a chapter I  only get stuck one one or two things, sometimes it is a lot easier for me to jump onto next thing and think about coming back to it later ( it gives a sense of accomplishment , even if it is false) when my brain understands more things… see if I am unable to understand one thing and pull myself down and waste too much time, then it just does not help one’s psychology.  That is why I just wanted to feel comortable I guess and reassured that it will come to me  and its a normal process 

Hello @byte1052171993 
Don’t get discouraged, every body has their own challenges when starting something new.
Coding takes time to learn, if you are having trouble understanding a concept, take your time on the lesson. Read it and reread it if you have to.
Certainly make sure you don’t rush yourself. When I first started Python, I rushed through the lessons, not giving myself enough time to understand the concept. Before long I was becoming reliant on the solution button, and when I tried to use what I learned, my mind went blank. As such I had to retake the course.
I find it is also helpful to practice what you learn on your own. Make a small project that focuses on a single concept.
Don’t lose hope, take your time and be paitent. If you want to learn something than you certainly can 




 byte1052171993:

not sure how low should I go, what is the benchmark.


The benchmark is what you are able to do right now. It will only be raised when competency increases. Start from square zero and don’t be in a hurry to leave that square until you master it, and can do it with your eyes closed. Think in code so you learn to ideate.




 byte1052171993:

it is a lot easier for me to jump onto next thing and think about coming back to it later


At times this can be okay, but I would not recommend it. Most of Codecademy’s lessons rely on concepts they taught in previous ones. If you are experimenting on your own this may work, but it may also require something that you do not know.

Thanks a lot, I appreciate your inputs.

To me it’s very similar to learning a new language or new instrument (I say this because I relate to these experiences as a bilingual musician).
The initial feeling of being completely lost is completely normal, and good!
It means your organism is going to try to make a provisional hierarchy of structure for hanging on. The important thing is to stay positive, try to do a little bit every day even if it feels like you’re not good, and to be communicative with others about the process.
What you do with it afterwards is up to you. But you definitely the skills to cover the basics. Get through a few months before deciding whether it’s for you or not. I played viola for 1 year in school and didn’t think much of it, but it became my profession… I never would have thought. New ideas always need space to grow in us.

Thank you for your encouragement ,  I really appreciate it 

Hello @byte1052171993. I know there has been a lot of good words from @mtf, @8-bitgaming and @toastedpitabread, but I’m going to say something as well:
I find, when I’ve just learnt a new concept (be it in coding, music, maths, life), I like to try it out. With coding, that means a mini project or task. This can be something that you either set yourself, or find on the internet or CC, or elsewhere. These little projects really help you to cement your knowledge, and to build on what you have. I would recommend Codewars, as it gives you little mini-projects; they don’t take too long, but some of the tasks really get you thinking, and you can pick up a lot of interesting concepts while attempting a task. Also, when Googling things, if you’ve come across something you don’t understand, play with it! Find a compiler (online or otherwise-if you want an online compiler, repl.it is quite good), and try out what you’ve found on Google, and experiment with it a little bit.
Happy coding!

Hello ! I am an teen . I want to learn web development and game creation . I am new to code i have not have alot of experience with code . I am studying hard to learn code .
I am currently learning Python . I am learning Python on the basic version because i am not the strongest financially . I was wondering if you guys have any tips to help on the journey.  Feel free to comment !

Hello @mdtahmed2838411816!! Welcome to the forums 
Is there something specific you are struggling with?
If not I would recommend reading the above.



 mdtahmed2838411816:

I am learning Python on the basic version


Python 2 is not a whole lot different than Python 3, you will find most of the commands and concepts are about the same. I took Python 2 courses on here for the same reason as you, but after a little bit of practice I easily transferred to Python 3.
I am not saying the Python 3 courses are pointless in any way, as I hope to be able to take them at some point. They dive a bit deeper into the code than the Python 2 course does.

Look at job listings and forums for game dev reqs. You’ll see a lot of people require C++ or C# among other things.
Honestly though, I think python is the perfect starting language these days if you’re new (I did java and c++ way back in the day), my reasons are that it is: flexible, thoughtfully structured, and has a big support community.
If you have time, after you’re comfortable with python, you could look into the rest of the  C family (including C!). It shouldn’t be that hard to transition once you know one language well.
Additionally check out CS50 youtube playlist for game creation, it’s a very solid intro for core concepts.

I totally agree with you but I think it’s better to first finish the course and then do your project or practice on Codewars or other competitive programming software. If you do these things while learning new concepts you could be frustated and don’t understand the big picture behind the idea as you don’t know certain commands. This could be extrapolated to all aspects in life, and as an example in math. As a curious person I’ve encountered big problems in my life because when I was learning the math from 7th grade I would ask myself this questions continually.  Why this happens? How? Pitifully all the people from my environment would do not respect me and even when trying to solve certain things, I would finish in the same position. I’m not saying that you should not ask those questions, just do it when you finish all the mechanization behind to have a bigger picture and do not struggle for what in 99.9% occasions means not solving your original question. Life is extremely difficult so is better to not overcomplicate ourselves more. With this being said, happy coding everyone. I’m going to the top of the hill so I will be waiting all of you to create new projects that may change the world. See you there!

I have my editor and all the other things to program in my computer and I thought I will really like to practice building an app or some big project. Can anyone tell me please what should I do to use my knowledge in a productive way?
Thanks a lot!!
","
Hello @design7719027421 and welcome to the Codecademy community 
Since you already have your editor, I think the first thing you need to decide is what the purpose of your app is:

Do you want to process data
Are you planning on editing files
Is this supposed to automate something you would normally do manually
Will it work entirely on your computer, or will it have access to the internet

Next, based on what you are planning to do, you need to decide what language you want to use.
It may be a good idea to do some research on which language would be best for what you are planning.
A few good ones are:

Python
JavaScript
C++

Once you have picked a language, make sure you have the compiler set up on your computer. I would recommend doing a quick Hello World just to make sure there are no problems.
Finally, start coding!!

You could have a quick nose around for examples of projects to work on. It doesn’t have to be completely novel but anything that can hold your interest will always be a good shout.
You could also have a look at some of the challenge/competition style websites that are available. I always found comparing my own code to an experienced developer’s to be rather helpful (if a bit of a rabbit hole). If you do go this route try to keep working on your own project and use knowledge from one to supplement the other. Challenges can be interesting and assist with learning but having your own project probably scans better on a CV. There’s an faq for that kinda thing here-




FAQ - Free resources to train your programming skills General Coding FAQ


    Practice makes perfect - following this age-old saying is very important for a programmer. The more problems we practice solving in a language, the more perfect our skills in that language become.

110,On the topic of resourcefulness when writing code,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
I heard someone in a Codecademy video say “Googling is 80% of a software developer’s life.” This was a relief to hear because, for like 20 years, I felt like an inferior coder because I couldn’t solve problems without searching for the answer. (Interiority complex is a real thing …)
My question is, when is this resourcefulness, and when is it just copying the code you find and modifying it for your needs? What do you learn by searching, landing on a Stackoverflow page, copying some code, and then modifying it so it solves your problem? Do you learn as much as you would by trying to solve it on your own for half an hour and then going to other sites and borrowing code from the developers who went before you?
If I modify some code I find on the internet, I try to at least read through it and understand what it’s doing before I paste it into my code editor. Is that enough?
I guess what I’m looking for is your process for learning … at what point do you stop dealing in theory and start looking for the specific answer to what you’re trying to solve? Does that matter?
Thanks for pondering this with me.

I heard someone in a Codecademy video say “Googling is 80% of a software developer’s life.” This was a relief to hear because, for like 20 years, I felt like an inferior coder because I couldn’t solve problems without searching for the answer. (Interiority complex is a real thing …)


As the great William Shakespeare wrote,

“The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.”

There is, I would argue, never any harm or grounds for derision in realising one doesn’t know something and searching for an answer. 



 redfrau:

My question is, when is this resourcefulness, and when is it just copying the code you find and modifying it for your needs? What do you learn by searching, landing on a Stackoverflow page, copying some code, and then modifying it so it solves your problem? Do you learn as much as you would by trying to solve it on your own for half an hour and then going to other sites and borrowing code from the developers who went before you?


I think this would depend on whether you understand the solution that you come across.
Blindly copying and pasting blocks of code from somewhere like SO, which we may not understand entirely, at best represent a missed learning opportunity. At worst, you could be introducing some serious errors and vulnerabilities into the program.



 redfrau:

If I modify some code I find on the internet, I try to at least read through it and understand what it’s doing before I paste it into my code editor. Is that enough?


If you’re searching for a code snippet to aid you in solving a problem you’re staring down, and taking the time to look into why that solves the problem and improve your understanding rather than simply saying “Eh, it works…” and moving on, then I’d say you’re fine. It might take a few iterations before a particular programming pattern or method sticks and you can recall it easily, but that’s part of learning.



 redfrau:

I guess what I’m looking for is your process for learning … at what point do you stop dealing in theory and start looking for the specific answer to what you’re trying to solve?


I’d say it’s not so much about arriving at a point where you recognise that what you know at present is insufficient and going to find an “answer”. It’s more about realising that you don’t know X, finding a solution using Y and Z, and utilising that to expand your knowledge.
It’s the same as if we were discussing homework at school; those who do it themselves learn the material, by studying it but also by making mistakes and figuring out how to resolve them. Those who simply copy what they presume to be “correct” don’t.

Spot on.

@redfrau
I’d say that, two problems, although they may look fairly similar (trying to achieve a similar goal) are never entirely the same. Blind copy-pasting might not always fit within one’s attempt to fix said problem.
Which in turn brings new opportunities in finding alternative ways of solving a problem that has now been extended through third-party influence. This could, however, lead to a vicious circle.

Then there’s the problematic of determining the best path towards a solution. I reckon it’s quite common practice among newer devs to reach a presumed solution by adding blocks of code they have a limited understanding of. You can usually easily spot code that originated from some obscure blog post 12 years ago. I see this happening a lot in the PHP community. It might work at first, but one could ponder on the ramifications if it were to break down the road.
What then? Can it be detected, let alone fixed? Does it pose a security risk one’s not aware of?
If one’s not able to understand it, and comment it, should it be used in the first place?

The other aspect I see, however, is the principle of not reinventing the wheel. Making use of third-party code could prove helpful in one’s attempt to reach a working solution faster, better, without spending precious time on yet another attempt in coming up with an already established solution. This is what libraries, modules, and frameworks generally help solve (speaking of resourcefulness).

Question
What are some important skills needed to be a DevOps Engineer?
Answer
The DevOps Engineer role requires a broad skillset because it covers the entire release process of a product. Some of the most important skills required are given as follows.
One of the most vital skills of a DevOps engineer is software development. DevOps engineers typically have knowledge of multiple technologies and tools used in software development, including knowledge in programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, or JavaScript. Engineers will use these technologies and tools to make the software and frameworks needed for the products and to accomplish tasks such as automation.
Another important skill of a DevOps engineer is IT operations. A DevOps engineer should have experience with IT roles including system, network, and server administration. DevOps engineers should also be able to test, deploy, troubleshoot and provide QA support regarding the products that are released.
Some other important skills include source control, communication and collaboration, as well as the ability to make good business decisions.
","
I am a few weeks from turning 48. While I am truly considering this field can one advise me on the length of time for mastering or becoming fluent in the aforementioned skill sets?

112,What is cross tabulation?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what is cross tabulation?
Answer
In general, cross tabulation is a way to analyze relationships and other information about data.
An example of using cross tabulation is shown in this exercise, which shows the labels and the number of points that actually fall under each species.
labels    setosa    versicolor    virginica
0              0             2           36
1             50             0            0
2              0            48           14

We can see, based on this cross tabulation, how accurate the results were, and understand it a lot easier and more clearly than if we had gone through all the rows in the dataset and determined the accuracy in that manner.
Using the pd.crosstab() method in Pandas, we can perform cross tabulation on our data, and by default, it will provide a frequency table. However, we can also apply aggregate functions to the data to analyze information other than the frequencies. For example, we can get the average of values by providing the np.average function to the aggfunction parameter of the method, like so,
pd.crosstab(..., aggfunction=np.average)

","
I still don’t know how to read the results by cross tabulation. For example, the results shown here is bad because 50 samples that should have label 1 are categorized into “setosa” which has label 0?

The important thing is how many data points are put into one group. 1, 2, 3, in this case, are just the number of the groups. For setosa all data points got put into one group, this means that it is very exact

Does that mean that our method was very exact, but wrong?
Like, high accuracy and low precision?

I would start by fixing the indent of your code. This issue is currently hard to debug because of it.
this error is generally caused by forgetting to close something (like a function, loop or condition). And sure enough when i go stand on the opening curly bracket of your function:
const determineWinner = (userChoice, computerChoice) => {

i don’t see any matching closing curly bracket light up in the editor.

I’ve not worked through all your code, but already I can see that your ‘if’ statements have an issue.
You need to use === (an equality operator) in an ‘if’ statement, not a = which just declares a variable as equal.
EDIT: OK, I’ve had a bit more of a look, and at the moment your code in the getComputerChoice function doesn’t return any values. At present your function produces a random number (0, 1 or 2), but doesn’t do anything with it. You’ll need to return what you calculate in that function:
const getComputerChoice = () => {
return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
}


Hi, thanks for your response.Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 12.04.07 PM960×701 115 KB  i fixed those parts, but still getting a syntax error msg.

Hi! I don’t think you should be using a ; after the closing } of your if  statements.

Yes, and it also looks like you have an extra } which is floating at the end of your code. It’s highlighted in your editor as red to show you that it’s dangling.
EDIT: Looking again, I think you might need to relook at the section from Line 10 to Line 22. Your getComputerChoice function ends at Line 12. Is that what you intend? How would you describe what you hope the behaviour of Lines 10-22 to be?




 sivwri:

You need to use === (an equality operator) in an ‘if’ statement, not a = which just declares a variable as equal.


I’ll put my hand up immediately and say this is pedantry, but === is the “strict equality” operator and not the equality operator (==).
If you simply want to confirm that two values are equal, you ought to use the equality operator:
// everything here is a number
2 == 2.0 // true
4 === 4.0 // true

The “strict equality” operator includes the requirement that both operands are of the same type. So, let’s say we’re working with “truthy/falsey” values and we do this:
1 == true // true
""true"" == true // true
1 === true // false

Not necessarily an important difference here, perhaps, but == and === aren’t the same (and the preference for the latter is something I personally find irritating…).



 yizuhi:

I don’t think you should be using a ; after the closing } of your if statements.


That looks like the problem to me too…

I agree with all of that, especially that it’s pedantry  I can’t recall if the Codecademy course teaches the difference by this point, but I don’t think it does so I opted to just suggest the strict equality which the op has used elsewhere in their programme correctly.
Besides, given the variable type is known, why not use a strict equality? It seems that is a matter of preference. Feel free to DM me separately as I don’t think this thread is really about that question.

@sivwri
I’m attempting to get the computer to give/print me a random number (integer) between 0-2. Each of these numbers should represent either rock, paper or scissors.

Hello @cloud4562193327. Take at look at your else statement as well. Should you have a condition after it?
The purpose of the else is to cover all other cases, so when you provide a condition, it throws an error, as you are telling the computer in all other cases, when ""object"" equals ""condition"", do the following. If you told that to a human, they’d get confused. When the computer gets confused, it throws an error.

I can see that this part of your programme is going to generate a number between 0 and 2:
const getComputerChoice = () => {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
}

But do you see that the } at the end of that section actually ends the getComputerChoice function? Line 13-20 are really part of the main body of the code. You’ll need to:

Remove the ; before the if at the end of line 16 and before the else in line 18.
Rewrite lines 10-22 as one function. Ask yourself if you need to generate the random number twice (which it currently does). When you rewrite the function, you might end up using the dangling } in line 22, but make sure you check because at the moment it’s unused and will give you a syntax error!

Let us know how you get in, and do copy and paste your new code here if you get stuck!

118,How does changing the values of m and b affect the shape of the line?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how does changing the values of m and b affect the shape of the line?
Answer
The value of m is known as the slope of a line. This value determines the incline or how much the line is slanted. Changing this value effectively rotates the line, where the axis of rotation is around the y-intercept value.
Increasing the slope will cause the line to become steeper, or closer to vertical, while decreasing the slope will cause the line to become flatter, or closer to horizontal.
The value of b is the y-intercept of a line. This value is where the line intercepts the y-axis, which is the value of y when x is 0. To quickly show this, when x is 0, we obtain y is equal to b,
y = m*x + b
  = 0*x + b
  = 0 + b
  = b

Changing the y-intercept value will essentially shift the line upward or downward on the graph along the y-axis. Increasing this value will shift the line upward while decreasing it will shift the line downward.

123,How can we determine when loss changes very slowly?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how can we determine when loss changes very slowly?
Answer
We learned that convergence is reached when loss stops completely or changes very slowly.
We can determine when the loss is changing very slowly in a few ways.
One way, which is used in this exercise, is by looking at a graph showing the number of iterations vs the slope or intercept value. When we see that the parameter value is changing very slowly, we can choose one of the values around which that happens.
Another way is to choose our own loss value, such that once the loss is less than that value, we can say there is convergence. For example, we can choose a value like 0.01, and if the loss is less than this, then it has converged and we can stop.

Shouldn’t it be the difference of loss between iterations?
We have seen in the exercise where we coud adjust the slope and the intercept, that the minimal loss value can be quite large, depending on how the points are distributed…

The accepted answer implies known values of acceptable loss rates. I guess this won’t be known in most cases. And as @pre replied, it’s best we derive an acceptable loss by means of differences of values over iterations.

124,Learn Python: pipenv,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
I have pipenv installed but when I type pipenv --version it says ‘command not found: pipenv’. I’m just confused about this whole pip/pipenv installation process.
I have two python versions installed in my machine. When I give command ‘% python – version’, it tells me ‘Python 2.7.16’.  And for ‘% python3 – version’, it tells me ‘Python 3.7.3’.
For command ‘% pip – version’, it says ‘command not found: pip’. But for ‘% pip3 – version’, this is what I get
‘pip 19.0.3 from /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)’.
So my understanding is that I have pip3 installed but not pip.
Also, following the instructions in the video tutorial, I wasn’t able to install pipenv using ‘pip install --user pipenv’, it just said that ‘command not found: pip’. I had to use pip3 install --user pipenv to install pipenv.
I also updated the path in bash_profile and followed the rest of the instructions all along. After updating the bash_profile when I eventually typed pipenv --version, it still said command not found: pipenv, even though I have followed all the instructions.
What am I doing wrong?
Note: In my terminal, the shell prompt is % and not $, so would my path directory in bash_profile file would be ‘/Users/corey/Library/Python/3.7/bin:%PATH’ or ‘/Users/corey/Library/Python/3.7/bin:$PATH’

Sounds like you were able to install it, you just aren’t running it. Also, if pip belongs to python 2 then you probably shouldn’t be using it, you would use the pip that comes from your python 3 installation.

Where is that text located? Is it a question?

Yes, it’s a question on one of the review quizes

I’m not seeing this on the page you linked to above.
The only thing I can relate to the quote above if there is an array of colors and we’re asked to return the index of a specific color in the.
 colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']

 console.log(colors.indexOf('violet'))    // 6

Hello @byte5723385929, as @mtf said, the question doesn’t always come up. Do you mean something like this:
/*Make this output 6*/
let color =  ;
console.log(color);

And you have to fill in the number for color?

I tried to link to the question but I i couldn’t so i posted the question
“The JavaScript variable  color  should be assigned such a value for which the last line of the given code block will print  6  in the console”
I don’t know what it’s asking or why i didn’t learn this when I’ve repeated each of these exercises dozens of times…where did it show how to make a color print a number?

What color would make 6? Is it like a hexcode?

No, in this case, I think you’d just put select 6, as in, you have to select a number, but if you could send a photo of the quiz questions with the multiple choice answers, that would help us help you.

ok, I’ll try to get a screen cap of the question with answers and post here.

127,While loop condition question,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
def delete_starting_evens(lst):
  while (len(lst) > 0 and lst[0] % 2 == 0):
    lst = lst[1:]
  return lst

Write a function that removes elements from the front of a list until the front of the list is not even. The function should then return list.
Why do we need to have len(lst) > 0 condition in the while statement.
","
Hello @java9059758472, I believe the reason for this is so that the code isn’t attempting to run on an empty list. So, if you have an empty list passed into the function, and that isn’t there:
def delete_starting_evens(lst):
  while (lst[0] % 2 == 0):
    lst = lst[1:]
  return lst

Then this error appears:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""Main.py"", line 7, in <module>
    print(delete_starting_evens([]))
  File ""Main.py"", line 4, in delete_starting_evens
    while (lst[0] % 2 == 0):
IndexError: list index out of range

This occurs because the loop is attempting to find the index 0 of an empty list, which has nothing in it, and therefore nothing to index.
The len(lst) > 0 is also there in case the list is all even numbers, in which case you should have an empty list returned. The length of an empty list is 0, so that condition stop the loop attempting to work on an empty list, similar to the above reason.
The same error occurs if you have the conditions the other way around:
def delete_starting_evens(lst):
  while (lst[0] % 2 == 0 and len(lst) > 0):
    lst = lst[1:]
  return lst

This happens because Python evaluates from left to right, so it reaches the first condition (lst[0] % 2 == 0), and, in the case of an empty list, finds nothing at that index (index is out of range), so it raises that error.
I hope this helps!

Hi there, hope everyone is doing safe during this pandemic;
I am taking the learn python: syntax course on Codecademy part of the -learn computer science path. I was wondering if someone could help me with the module as an operator, it is mentioned that it could be used to run something every nth time the code runs … could you please clarify how and why it works? also, what are other uses in real life coding for modules? excuse my ignorance.
thanks a lot.
","
Do you mean modulo operator? You seem to describe modulo operator, but you wrote module everywhere.
There are plenty of practical usages. You will run into them over time. We could use the modulo operator to determine of numbers are odd or even. Some people use it for styling (to have alternating colors)
When a concept is introduced, the practical applications might not always be clear, you will run into this more often. Just trust that over time the practical applications will come through. But you need to learn the concept first.

Oh sorry its autocorrect. yes I meant the modulo operator.  I just don’t get how they could be used to run something every nth time the code runs. Screen Shot 2020-05-20 at 12.24.09 PM1196×242 23.3 KB

Well, if we have a loop, we could use the modulo operator to something on the even or odd number of the iterations.

Oh I see. Say I have a code in c
for (int I = 0 ; I < 0 ; I++) {
      #code .. 
      }
      return;

how would i implement the modulo to do something every nth time, say every odd?
thanks a lot btw 

or in python:
for i in range(10):
   print(i)

you could use a conditional (if) and then check if even (== 0) or odd (!= 0)

Okay thanks, that makes more sense, I thought there was a way in which the a mod would be used inside the for condition statement.

This sounds like you are wondering the difference between passing by value and passing by reference? Anyways, you are absolutely correct that current would equal 5 because it was given the value of self.value before the next line self.value += 1 that changes the 5 to a 6!

I saw in a youtube tutorial that the reference was added with an addition 1 and then returned that way using this exact same setup. After the guy in the video ran his code, it worked. That confused me big time, so what do you think?

That’s interesting. Do you happen to have the entire code script so we can look for clues? Or the video?

At the moment that’s only defining constructors and a variable (unless I’m missing something).

This is a custom iterator. Add the following code after the nums instance:

This might be beyond the scope of the Codecademy intent.  Maybe a moderator will chime in.

@harrjt has the right interpretation of the code you provided in that image. As for the first question,
yes, current would still be 5. Integer objcects are not mutable, using the same name for a different integer would change the reference and not the object. You could test this relatively quickly.
a = 2
print(id(a))
b = a
print(id(b))  # Same id
a = 4
print(id(a))  # Not the same object in memory.
a is b  # Evaluates to False
I’d be wary of stating that values change, all you’re doing with those statements is add/removing references to particular objects.
As an additional piece of half-remembered info…
It’s worth keeping in mind there’s something about a number of python integers, -5 to 256 I believe that are held as objects in memory from start-up. You’d have to look that up though as I can’t remember it well enough to try and explain it. Sorry.

https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-flow-data-iteration/modules/dspath-lists/lessons/create-python-list/exercises/zip
The course mentions that a zip creates a list of lists, but that doesn’t make sense. I think it is suppose to mean a list from lists? or maybe I am reading it wrong. The reason why I bring this up is because there are two items in a pair, but they become one identity (item) in the overall list.
I might be wrong on that conclusion, but let me know what you think pairs are. Are pairs its own lists or an item? I need help with a definite answer on what pairs are.
Thank you,
MP
","
If it’s python2 zip creates a list of tuples. If you’ve not come across tuples you can just consider them as immutable lists for the time being. Worth looking into in the future.
So your ‘pairs’ are actually tuples of objects from the two separate sequences. python3 is similar but much nicer as it returns a zip object which functions as an iterator where each element is a tuple.
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]
zipped_dat = zip(lst1, lst2)
print(zipped_dat)  # for python2
Out: [(1, ""a""), (2, ""b""), (3, ""c"")]  # Your 'pairs' are (1, ""a""), (2, ""b"")...

zipped_dat = zip(lst1, lst2)
print(list(zipped_dat))  # for python3
Out: [(1, ""a""), (2, ""b""), (3, ""c"")] 
zipped_dat = zip(lst1, lst2)  # Needs to be rebuilt after exhaustion
for item in zipped_dat:
    print(item)
Out: (1, 'a') 
(2, 'b')
(3, 'c')

Bit more info on the zip fucntion-
https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#zip
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#zip

In this example:
…
Result: [(‘Jenny’, ‘Elphonse’), (‘Sam’, ‘Dr.Doggy DDS’), (‘Alexis’, ‘Carter’)]
What is the iterator? Is it ‘Jenny’ or ‘Elphonse’ or both or the whole list?
“Each element of the returned iterator is a tuple of values.” Now, I don’t understand what is the element that is the tuple… Is it (‘Jenny’, ‘Elphonse’)? Or the individual strings?
Sorry, I am having a hard time dissecting which is the iterator and element. Once I know what is being referred to then I can understand zip better.
Thanks,
MP

I’m not sure if it will help you with the zip function at this point. Perhaps I misunderstand your question but you seem more curious about the terminology than the result. I’d encourage you to just use the function and test the outputs and if that’s not enough look for examples of the zip function in use.
If you’re struggling with the terminology you can always look at the glossary-
https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator
To answer your more direct questions (based on python3 since you asked about the iterator version)-
For your example none of those items are iterator objects. The list itself is an iterable object (most sequences are iterable, e.g. lists, dicts, sets etc.).
The zip function takes two iterables and returns an iterator. In my given example you had two iterable sequences of [1, 2, 3] and [“a”, “b”, “c”].  Calling zip with these two sequences creates an iterator object (zipped_dat). If you were to iterate through every element in zipped_dat you would produce three separate elements. The first element is (1, “a”), a tuple which contains an integer and a single element string, the second would be (2, “b”) as per the example and so on.
In case my use of element still wasn’t clear, an extra example-
for element in [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]:
    print(element)  # each element here is just a single string

"
132,Regarding function call,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
def sing_song():
  print(""You may say I'm a dreamer"")
sing_song()

I understand that the function call by itself will execute the code inside the function, and would print “You may say I’m a dreamer”.
But when I call a function call inside print() as shown below, the output is “You may say I’m a dreamer None”. I don’t understand the logic of None in this print statement.
def sing_song():
  print(""You may say I'm a dreamer"")
print(sing_song())

","
print() is a function. It prints the argument passed to it. If you pass a string, it prints the string. If you pass a function call, it prints the return value of the function. A function that doesn’t explicitly return a value, implicitly returns none.
def sing_song():
    print(""You may say I'm a dreamer"")
    return ""I'm not the only one.""

print(sing_song())

Output:

You may say I’m a dreamer
I’m not the only one.

To avoid printing the implicitly returned none, you could just call the function:
sing_song()


You are getting None in your second function call because you did not return anything to your function. In Python 3, a print statement is a function. It will execute statement inside sing_song function, and then  start looking for other code to execute but there is none since you did not return anything back to sing_song. In order to avoid this, always use return in your function statements if you are going to use print in your function call.
def sing_song():
  return ""You may say I'm a dreamer""
print(sing_song())

I hope I was clear in my explanation.

That is the concatenation operator for joining strings and variables to form a single string. This is the old form of string interpolation.

This is meant to be an extremely simple example of the usefulness of functions in coding. Without the
+ ',' the return value of sandwich would be breadhamcheesebread instead of bread,ham,cheese,bread. It would be even more readable if we added a space in addition to the comma by changing it to + ', '.
The return value of sandwich would then be bread, ham, cheese, bread.



 maldimastephen339846:

Also the repetition of “topping1 and topping2” can not be repeated thus the function can not call duplicated layers; why?


This function can be customized in any way the programmer wishes. If we wanted to repeat the layers to make a double-decker sandwich (i.e. “bread,ham,cheese,ham,cheese,bread”) we could re-write it like this:
function makeSandwich(topping1, topping2) {
  sandwich = 'bread' + ','
  sandwich += topping1 + ','
  sandwich += topping2 + ','
  sandwich += topping1 + ','
  sandwich += topping2 + ','
  sandwich += 'bread'
  return sandwich
}

The “Learn How to Code” course is a beginning course. There are many ways this example function could be refactored to be more concise and more useful. As you progress through learning to code you’ll see what I mean. Happy coding!

// Define the ‘makeSandwich()’ function
function makeSandwich(topping1, topping2, topping3) {
sandwich = ‘bread’ + ‘,’
sandwich += topping1 + ‘,’
sandwich += topping2 + ‘,’
sandwich += topping3 + ‘,’
sandwich += ‘bread’
return sandwich
}

result = makeSandwich(‘jelly’, ‘cheese’, ‘ham’)

 krd.0236221499612:

+ ‘,’


It could be just a matter of missing white space after the comma so the toppings are separated as in a sentence.

I think it’s just a comma, so it doesn’t read it as breadhamcheesebread, for example. Instead it reads it as bread, ham, cheese, bread. I don’t think it really matters because you’re not printing the strings anyways.

I just have one simple question, so why is the first line sandwich= ‘bread’ + ','
but at the end it it’s sandwich += 'bread’
Why use = at the start and use += at the end.

The whole process is that of building a single string from all the aggregate components.
We start with the top slice, so it is a direct assignment…
sandwich = 'bread, '

It was/is unnecessary to concatenate with another literal character so above we have it included in the initial string value.
Given that we want to continue this string (as in grow it) we use the augmentation operator to preserve whatever value to we add to.
sandwich += 'ham, '
sandwich += 'cheese, '

The final augmentation will be the other slice of bread.
sandwich += 'bread'

Notice how we only use direct assignment when we are initializing the string? That should answer your question as to why. Assignment replaces whereas augmentation, well, augments. It adds to or continues.

function makeSandwich(topping1, topping2,topping3) {
sandwich = ‘bread’ + ‘,’
sandwich += ‘peanut butter’ + ‘,’
sandwich += ‘jelly’ + ‘,’
sandwish += ‘pickles’ + ‘,’
sandwich += ‘bread’ + ‘,’
return sandwich
}
result = makeSandwich('peanut butter ', ‘jelly’, ‘pickles’)
where is the fault plz help me !!

Hello, @zinoubghbenz78810214.
Welcome to the forums.
Look closely at your spelling of sandwich on every line. 
Also, you should be using topping1, topping2 & topping3 in your code in place of peanut butter, jelly & pickles
For example:
sandwich += topping1 + ','


thank u very much i see now  the difference

Very helpful answer. Thanks!

We can also view the change in the string due to the value of result because of the commas, commas with space and even no commas

Any help which will help me even build a picture of what Im trying to do would be very helpful.  Choices/options I could choose etc.   Thanks in advance
","
Hello @ajax0717771947, welcome to the forums. Seeing you want to build a website, I would learn HTML, CSS, then JavaScript. That should give you the ability and functionality to do what you want. But, if you’re already doing the Python course, don’t worry. If you have no time pressure, you can finish learning that (as it will help with learning JS). You should also look into learning node.JS and other JS frameworks/libraries.
I hope this helps!

Thanks for the response.  I will be needing to scrape data from websites first.  Then I thought python would be a way to build the simulation?  Or am I mistaken and doing it a hard way?  In the data science course its goes on to do matplotlib flask and pandas.  I thought maybe those would help? Do I have any options here?  Im completely lost.  Im sure there are different routes but to choose I need to know what they are so i can make a informed decision.  In my model simulation if I want to study the results while Im working on them  and also save users results do I need some sort of database?  Sorry lots of questions.  Time wise I would rather focus of things that will make an already ambitious project achievable in less time. Im sure I will be learning extra and having to correct course but Im going to try to minimize it as much as possible.

Hello. I don’t know the answer to all of those questions, but I will try to answer the ones I can. If you want to do webs scraping, I think Python’s Beautiful Soup can allow you to web-scrape. Pandas might also be useful, although I cannot say for sure. If you want to save user’s input for more than one time (i.e. username, etc) then yes, a database would be useful. I recommend SQL, although Pandas might help (I’m not exactly sure). You will need to work with HTML and CSS. The only programming languages I know that can do that are JS and PHP (I’ve done more with PHP, but still not as much as what your project would require).
Overall:
I would recommend finishing the Python course, and learning Pandas and Beautiful Soup. Then, HTML, CSS and JS (although you could do this all in one, if you take the Web-dev path, but that requires PRO). Being able to communicate with databases would be useful, so learn SQL. There is also ‘R’, which seems to be a language used to deal with data and statistics, although you would definitely have to look into that one more, as I have only briefly dealt with it. On the PHP front, I’m not sure. It is a backend language, however, JS does have the ability to backend (node.JS, if I remember correctly) and front-end, so if you wanted to reduce your learning load, maybe not PHP.
But again, I stress that this is just from what I’ve picked up; you should look into these things more (either on Google, or other forum questions), if you want more definitive answers.
Sorry I couldn’t help more!

current working directory (cwd) is mostly used in command line. Because in the command line, we can open a directory in subfolder (several layers deep). Lets say the CWD is project A, we can open the stylesheet using: nano resources/css/stylesheet.css
but this won’t change the current working directory, we are still in the project A directory
CWD has little to do with which file(s) you open, more about navigating when changing directory (cd command)

Ok, I think I understand now - thanks!

136,Advice for creating a tarot card reading website! How to display a random image with a link,"Get Help,General Programming",,6,"
Hi there,
New to coding and web design and have been asked to help on a project. The person wants a small website (3-4) pages for tarot readings. The home page is a ‘button’, when you click on it, it generates a ‘tarot card’ reading. These tarot cards are pre-made small videos, so when you get a reading it will take you to a new page with the ‘card’ - a small short tarot video - and some text about the reading. Is this possible using html and css, if I want to attempt to build a website from scratch? Does anyone familiar with wordpress know if it would be possible to customise a wordpress site so it can do this?
Any suggestions for where I can look or how one might be able to do this would be very much appreciated!
Thanks
Leila

Hello @ruby7952581205, welcome to the forums! When you say a small video and text, do you mean a set video? Or do you mean taking a few random ones from a larger database? If your goal is the first one, then yes, you could do it with HTML and CSS. If you mean the second one, I think you’d have to learn JS and possibly a database communication language (like SQL).
If you meant the first one:
You want a few pages, so if you had three pages, and then the homepage, you could divide the homepage into three divs, each one linking to on page. (If you’re familiar with CSS grid, that might be handy). You could then simply have each page being linked having its own tarot reading.
I hope this helps!

hmmm…interesting. so it’s basically sa 26 gif files (these are the tarot cards). The user will click on a ‘button’ and this will generate a random tarot card gif (from the selection of 26). When this gif/tarot is generated, it will also be accompanied by some text. So do you think this is possible with CSS and HTML?
It might be that your suggestion is better. So, more or less, I create a different page for each tarot card (gif)…it’s the random element that is confusing me. The ‘computer’ sort of randomly selects a card almost, or at least, the user is not consciously choosing a card… Could you explain perhaps how your suggestion might work with this?
Thanks so much

There are two possibilities here:
html, css and JS.
or
html, css, sql and a back-end language (there are several)
I think the first one is simpler, you upload the gifs to a CDN. Then in JS you make an array with objects, the object contain the text and gif location/url for each carrot
then with JS, select a random element from the array, and update the page. You wouldn’t even need separate pages.

Ok, thank you so much.
I have one more question. Have you got any experience with Wordpress? Do you think it will be possible to do this on wordpress, or is it better for me to try and build the website from Scratch? Unfortunately wordpress don’t allow you a trial so if I want to trial it I have to pay, but I’m not sure it will let me actually do the things I want to do.

No experience with wordpress (well, so little its not worth mentioning)
Why would you need entire CMS for such a task? It adds a lot of abstraction, and might be overwhelming if you know very little about html, css, php and mysql/mariadb.
is it possible to use wordpress? Very likely.

Hey Scotch,
Welcome to the forums.
So that’s a tough task, and the “language” is the least of your concerns. Cool project, though.
Whether it’s Yahoo, Hotmail (Outlook), Gmail, AOL, iCloud… the language doesn’t really matter.
Yahoo was built with PHP, and Outlook probably C# with .NET. Gmail, C++ and Java.
And there’s, obviously, always JavaScript on the front-end.

You could use Ruby, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Node.js, C++, Go… it doesn’t matter.
This is probably why you’re not getting a straight forward answer. I don’t think there is one.

So you’ll need a few of them anyway,

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
SQL (?)

And then one of

Ruby / Python / Java / C# / PHP / JavaScript (Node.js) / C++ / Go

It’s a matter of preference. If you don’t want to learn more languages than you have to, stick to JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end.
If you want something easy to learn and deploy, use PHP.
If you want a challenge, go with Java or C++.
You could also just build a MVP in a simpler language, and then rebuild in something else.




 scotchnrox:

so the best


Debatable. Best in terms of? Out of those mentioned, probably C++. But then again, debatable.



 scotchnrox:

easiest language


I’m biased, but PHP. Easy to learn, deploy, runs everywhere, for cheap.



 scotchnrox:

which would get the job done


They all would.

Why not give some of those a shot (all available here on Codecademy), just to have a quick glance at their syntax and see which you like best? If you want something easy to learn; PHP, Python, Ruby. If you only want one language on both the front-end and back-end, JavaScript.
You’ll also have to look into networks, servers, protocols, security…
Best of luck!

Wow that’s amazing!
I wasn’t expecting such an in-depth answer but this is really helpful and I truly appreciate the time you took to respond 
I’m actually looking for partners on this project as well so if I couldn’t manage to build it myself I now at least know what skills I need people to have before I hire them.
Thanks again

You can’t convert a tuple to an int, but you can convert the string inside the tuple into an int:

    for j in i:
        print(int(j))

Of course you probably don’t want to just print the int value, but this should show you how to access the string inside the tuple.

140,Do I have to possess a special kind of intelligence to have a chance to become a programmer?,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
Hello,
it’s been a bit more than 4 months since I started learning programming from 0 here at Codecademy, not every day though and quite slowly, but I’m still here willing to continue. Recently I read on the Internet about the real-life 3-months beginner’s course on Python (which I’m learning at Codecademy) that was starting in late September here in my country. I’m thinking about applying to it because thought it was a great chance to find some new inspiration and meet people interested in the topic.
However, again I started questioning myself if I was actually talented enough for this. I might be wrong but to me it seems that programming requires a special kind of intelligence, a mind that operates very logically, and when i mention logic I don’t mean kind of a ‘‘life logic’’ where one is intelligent where he is simply rational and knows how to have a good and balanced life. Here by logic I rather mean having a machine-like mind. And honestly I’m not sure if I possess it.
I would be very happy to hear some appreciated opinions on this. Is one limited with lacking of talent and ‘‘mathematical’’ intelligence? How much in those cases could one overcome with hard work? Should he be overcoming anything at all if he’s not talented and just give up?
Thank you.
","
I’m sure programming or coding comes easier to some than others, but I wouldn’t say there is some kind of special intelligence required. A computer is just a machine. Without a detailed list of instructions, it just sits, and collects dust. If you can break down a task into the steps required to complete the task, you can learn to code. Learning a computer language like Python is similar to learning a spoken language. It takes practice. Lots of practice. It’s possible that programming may not be for you, but if you’re interested in it, and willing to invest the time and effort to learn, I’m sure you can do it.

According to this article, there are approximately 26,4 million developers in the world. I’m sure they don’t have a special, ultra-rare gene sequence in common. I know people who at 40 were struck by structural unemployment, they simply had to change their careers. It wasn’t easy for them, it took a lot of time and a lot of commitment but they succeeded. Being a programmer is just a career choice.
I work as a programmer. I am teaching and helping others that want to learn how to code. I make living out of programming. If you want to be one of the best programmers in the world it might be true that you need to have special predispositions. But if programming is what you want to do for a living, trust me, it’s just a time and work that matters.
Every programmer I know, myself included, had some bumps during the learning. They had to overcome many obstacles to become successful. But this is not limited to the programming, every career choice will require some commitment.

Thank you very much guys for your opinions. I’m inspired to continue learning despite simply not finding time to dedicate as much as I would like to. But I will try to give it a best shot and simply continue over and over again.
Thanks again, cheers.

A mind is a mind and quite flexible at that so if you can learn one thing well, you can learn another too. There isn’t this sort of thing “can’t learn Maths but can learn X”. So I wouldn’t worry about “talent” - just focus on learning well (aka the “hard” way, most often than not).
It’s worth stressing also that programming is not about language x or y and therefore not easily evaluated simply by looking at code. But then again, to actually understand what you are doing and get to grow, the fastest path is under a mentor who knows what they are doing and moreover is willing to shield you from all the noise that plagues “programming” nowadays.
Those who search will find that, those who don’t will more likely drown in the noise and give up in the end (or even worse, end up hating what they are doing on a daily basis).

Thank you for your answer. 

Great answer, thank you for your input.

Hello @miguelinera,
On this section:
else{ (choreDoor === 2)
    openDoor3 = botDoorPath
    openDoor1 = beachDoorPath;
    openDoor2 = spaceDoorPath;
    }
}


You’re missing the curly brace, it’s in the wrong place,  you’re missing a semi-colon, and it won’t read as an else code block because you’ve added a statement:
else  {
    openDoor3 = botDoorPath;
    openDoor1 = beachDoorPath;
    openDoor2 = spaceDoorPath;
    }
} 

That may fix your problem.
In addition to this, if you wanted to use an else block with a statement you’d need to do the following:
let isTrue = false;
if (isTrue) {
  return true;
} else if (!isTrue) {
  return false;
} else {
  return undefined;
}

In practice, the above code block would only use if and else statements and, it could be written more simply as:
const isTrue = val => return val; 

console.log(isTrue(false));


I hope this helps and apologies for the multiple edits.
Best wishes,
Richard.
P.S:
Also in the last function, you’ve coded:
const gameOver = (status) => { 
      if (status === ""win"") {
       startButton.innerHTML = 'You win! Play again?';
      };
  };

Although this may not be causing a problem, be careful with placement of semi-colons. It can sometimes show up as errors:

const gameOver = (status) => { 
      if (status === ""win"") {
       startButton.innerHTML = 'You win! Play again?';
      }
  };



Got it!! Thank you very much for your help. It worked perfectly.
Regarding the else and brackets I also thought it was incorrect, but as I saw it in the explanatory video of the project written like that I thought it was maybe common practice. The semicolons I added them all 
Here the link to the video, min 36:43:

Thanks again!

You are most welcome, @miguelinera. Remember don’t pick up bad habits from other people. Strictly speaking, JavaScript should still run without semi colons. Yes, you can forego semi-colons, in the same way you can walk down the street playing very loud music, that is, there is not to prevent you, should you? Probably not!
It is always best to get into the habit of adhering to the syntax of a language. This helps with compatibility.  For instance, an unrelated language, Java, requires you to use semicolons and will verbosely tell you that your are missing them.
Happy coding.

142,Why is the number of transistors in a computer important?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why is the number of transistors in a computer important?
Answer
The number of transistors in a computer is important because it correlates to a computer’s performance.
The main functionality of a transistor is to switch or to amplify electronic signals. These seemingly simple tasks are what makes things such as binary logic operations and ultimately computing possible. With more transistors, more of these actions can take place, at the same time. This is important because computers tend to do things in parallel, so more transistors will correlate to improvements in functionality and speed.
As the number of transistors grows over time, this means more powerful computers, and the ability for programmers to solve more difficult and complex tasks and problems. These tasks and problems may be in fields such as health, education, science, travel, and many others that require the use of computing.
","
It takes six transistors, or at least did originally in RCA CMOS RAM back in 1968, to store one BIT in memory. That means 48 for a single byte.
RCA COS/MOS 288-bit RAM Array 1968. Gift of Richard Ahrons
My TIMEX Sinclair had 4KB of RAM. That’s 48 times 4 times 1024 transistors.
48   == 2 ** 4  * 3
4    == 2 ** 2
1024 == 2 ** 10
     => 2 ** 16 * 3
     == 196 608

Nearly two hundred thoursand transistors for four kilobytes of RAM.
If your computer has 64 GB of RAM, that’s 48 times 64 times 2 ** 30.
48    ==  2 ** 4 * 3
64    ==  2 ** 6
1GB   ==  2 ** 30
      =>  2 ** 40 * 3
      ==  3 298 534 883 328

And that’s just the RAM. What about screen and audio memory? Buffers? Caches?
How many transistors are involved just keep the clock working?
Bottom line is we are in the age that could not have been predicted when this technology was newly formed. The number of generations since this CMOS was introduced is many. It all started with 288 bits and gradually snowballed from there.
This level of integration would have cracked Enigma in hours/days as opposed to weeks/months in the Second World War. Imagine all those transistors were vacuum tubes back then. How many bits of memory could they even keep alive back then? And how much space would it take to store one kilobyte of RAM? Integration brought things from building size to room size to refrigerator size to bread box size to toaster size to coaster size to postage stamp size to pin head size to microdot size in a matter of decades.
Now we have quantum computing that is using extremely low temperatures and super computers to perform tasks that used to take months in picoseconds. It is all thanks to the transistor and the logic gates that emerged from that technology.

Aside
Computer makers were thinking about system overhead, even back then and probably designed the extra 32 bits into the chip for the system to use, giving us the conventional 256 bits. Not to mention how convenient the 10, 10, 10, 10 pin configuration worked out for all the taps. That gives us enough room for eight four-bit registers, or four eight-bit registers, or two sixteen-bit registers on each 256 bit block of memory. For addressing this  would be most useful.
Learners today have no idea the minutae of the past. They have in their hands the progenations of it. We could never have conceived this back in the day, but secretly wianted it. Hence, we have it. Also hence, ‘Careful what you wish for.’
It is because of computing ability such as this that we have GPS tracking and Amazon, UBER and LYFT, Google and Facebook, to name just the apex of the technological pyramid. Grab on and don’t let go.

thanks sir this was a great information.

Ok, I understand how a transistor works and that more transistors mean more calculations at the same time but how can the system get access to this many transistors technically, that i don’t understand?

Wow, just wanted to say what a great source of info that was.

result = makeSandwich(‘peanut butter’, ‘jelly’)
","
"" in the original definition, how does the computer recognise the values of topping1 and topping2 as ‘burger patty’ and ‘pickles’ ? Why not anything else ?""
Answer: for any given function(parameter), the parameter is something that can be input by the user or by another action (like a function that has the role to change that parameter). The computer only recognizes these particular parameters as strings.
So for this example, it a further version of the program it would be possible for there to be 2 other functions getTopping1(topping) and getTopping2(topping) that pick out the variable topping from a list of of toppings.



 wind-o:

And in the exercise, how come ‘peanut butter’ and ‘jelly’ are recognised as topping1 and topping2 as well ?


In this immediate program, the final result is that the variable result has been given a value of the function makeSandwich(). It is a result that can be unique for every customer order (in a bigger theoretical implementation).



 wind-o:

I mean is it just because it’s a beginners course or is there a logic I can’t grasp ?


I wouldn’t get too frustrated. If one just completes the courses to get the right answer, then on won’t get as much value from each exercise. The key is for each exercise to reflect on what the core issues at play are, therefore expanding your understanding of such concepts. Anything that unsettles you, you should look up further documentation or ask like you’re doing! There is a learning curve, but it does get less frustrating once you start having a structure of concepts to sustain your doubts and fight back.

Thank you for your answer, it’s very helpful.

Question
Do we always have to optimize our algorithms?
Answer
No, but it is always good practice to try and optimize your algorithms and functions as much as possible and within reason.
In order to optimize an algorithm, it does take some time to think and solve the optimization, which is a tradeoff. However, this can result in a greater return in the long run, as an optimized algorithm will save us time when running programs.
In some cases, an optimization might even be necessary, if the current algorithm is too slow and we need to speed it up. This is increasingly important for large companies that depend on algorithms to keep things fast and dependable.

Hello @gcuoco37. I generally tend to write my HTML first, then CSS. For me, it helps when I can see my website’s skeleton (i.e. the HTML), and from there I can think ‘Yes, that should be orange. It is here, so i’ll put a class/id here.’ The best way, i find, is to plan what you want it to look like on paper, and then write the HTML, then the CSS. It also helps me keep my train of thought. If I write bits of HTML and CSS over a few days, I’ll end up forgetting my motive of the first day.
I hope this helps!

Thanks for the help.




 gcuoco37:

I wanted to write it out on paper first just to visualize it as well.


Mocking up the design beforehand is a good way of getting to grips with what you want where, and how you want things to look. That would, in turn, influence the CSS rulesets you need to write.
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with doing this on paper, by hand. However, there are numerous tools for creating wireframes and prototyping designs available these days. You could easily mock up the design for your site using such a tool, before setting about creating the actual site in code. 

After a mock up, as I’m building a site, I will do HTML and CSS for each section at the same time.  It’s just easier for me to keep track of each section of the website plus it gives me some inspiration to see parts of the site realized.
As I’m building each section, I also make sure to add comments for the HTML and CSS sections.    I do this while building rather than after building it.

That’s the difference between high-level and low-level languages.

High-level languages do a lot “under the hood” to make things simpler for us.
They’re human-friendly. Binary is machine-friendly. Because computers cannot understand human-friendly languages.
For example, in Go you’d write
fmt.Println(""Hello World"")
You’ll then have to compile this into a binary executable that the machine can understand.
So the compiler will translate high-level into low-level. Makes sense.
All languages translate into machine code. Some languages are compiled, like Go, C++, Java, Swift, others are interpreted, like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP.

Is there some way or program I can use to translate them into a language I can read, such as JavaScript. And then back again if I modify them?

So you want to reverse engineer? You could use a decompiler I guess (the opposite of the compiler)
https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/
And you could then recompile.
But I don’t think you’ll find a decompiler that translates to JavaScript. You’ll have to look it up.
This is used a lot in software security. And I guess in cracking as well. So, careful on your use case.
Also keep in mind that source code is often considered commercial secret, and can be protected by law. If it’s not open-source, you’ll want to be careful how you treat such code / what you do with it.
Hope this answers your question

Here is an example of the process of C code being broken down into machine code.
C code
a = b + 3 # add three and b and store in a
Gets compiled into assembly code - I’m going to use risc - v instructions
Assembly
addi x5, x7, 3 # same meaning as c code
This get broken down into binary machine code - according to a format determined by your computer architecture.
Risc - V machine code 32 bit instruction
00000000011 00111 000 00101 0010011
Don’t worry about what the binary means exactly, it is telling the machine to do a certain operation to certain areas of memory.
Now that binary could be stored as hexadecimal as you’ve seen
Hex representation of machine code
00338293
and that is how a = b+3 ends up being 00338293.

Basically to get into reverse engineering code, you need to learn about architecture. That is a long way away! Focus on learning high level programming for now, the low level stuff will follow

Thanks very much @ghostlovescore! That was a lot of very helpful information. 

Thank you very much for your advice @fight_dragons, but I have been doing high level code for a number of years now, and I am ready to begin expanding my knowledge.

I’d google various stuff like, cpu architecture, assembly, logic design, fetch-decode-execute, conversions between number systems. The godbolt compiler explorer is a great tool for seeing generated assembly.

Hi everyone! I’m somewhat new to web development! (Started around a month ago) I’ve gotten to be point where when I get errors in my code, I get really confused and anxious. I’m not sure if this is because I’m still in high school and that I can’t digest this or if I just have to have patience? Does anyone have anything tips on how to motivate themselves when coding? Thanks!
","
Hello @jnijnijni. When you get anxious/confused because of errors, take a step back and stop. Even go for a walk/take a day off. I presume you’re working with JS. JS errors are really quite descriptive. The best way, I find, in getting through errors is to read them carefully. They will often tell you exactly where the problem is. So, to fix many problems, just pause for a minute, even re-think what you need to do, then go back, and read the error, and your code. Also, Google is very much your friend; look things up that you don’t get and don’t be afraid to revisit topics that you’ve already done.



 jnijnijni:

I’m not sure if this is because I’m still in high school and that I can’t digest this or if I just have to have patience?


You definitely need to have patience. Take breaks, and revisit any topics that you are struggling with. If you are finding it difficult to digest things, slow down. Don’t rush ahead when you don’t need to, and slow down to a speed that allows you to easily take things in. Another thing I find is to set myself very small projects, which should utilise the skills I’ve just learnt. This helps you to cement knowledge. Also, when doing these projects, you will definitely need to look things up on the Internet/books (things like a specific built-in function; however, you shouldn’t be looking up major syntax-quite reviews are ok), as you should be setting projects that push your comfort zone, but not find yourself too far out of your depth.



 jnijnijni:

Does anyone have anything tips on how to motivate themselves when coding?


Projects. What I tend to do is have intermediate projects along the way. Every few concepts, stop, and set yourself (or do an online) project. This should take a few days and be enjoyable. That way, you’ll have motivation to get the content, so you can do something fun, whilst also helping you to cement the knowledge you’ve gained.
I hope this helps!

Hi there.

I think one thing that you ought to know is that everyone makes errors when programming. Nobody ever just sits down and hammers out a pristine program in one sitting with no mistakes.
It’s important to remember that getting an error in your program, much like making a mistake elsewhere, isn’t the end of the world. So you’ve fudged a line or two of your code… that’s fine. We’ve all done it. What matters is being able to debug your program; looking at the error message, figuring out what it’s telling you about why it doesn’t like what you wrote, and working out how to fix it.
To give you a bit of a real-world analogy: The Beatles didn’t just wake up one day and immediately start cranking out hit records, and neither will you just suddenly start knocking out perfect programs. It’s all about practice:

Write some code.
Run that code.
Fix the errors.
Repeat.

Along the way, if you find you’re staring at errors that you can’t figure out on your own then come here and ask for help. It’s what we’re here for. As you encounter and fix more errors on your own, you’ll not only get more confident at dealing with them as they come up but you’ll also be learning how not to cause those errors in the first place - ultimately resulting in you writing better code.

152,What does a validation set contain?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what does a validation set contain?
Answer
A validation set contains data that is used to determine how well a model is able to make predictions.
Generally, we first fit, or train, the model on training data. Once it has been trained, we validate how accurate it is by running the predictor with data from the validation set. After it makes the predictions, we check if they were correct based on the validation labels from the validation dataset. This process is applied to each point, and finally, the validation accuracy can be computed.
For an example, say that we have a predictor that determines what animal appears in an image. The validation set would consist of images with their labels, so that the model, once it has made predictions, can check how accurate it was.

155,Debugger Problem or not?,"Get Help,General Programming",,8,"
Hello,
I might have a debugger problem. I am new and I downloaded vs code.
I think I need to do some readjustment for  debugger, is there any videos where I can figure out some issues? i.e. when does it work properly and when not, I think because of debugger problems I get different results, when I use sort() method. I compare my results in vs code with the results on the codecademy platform,
the following code on the codecademy platform:
const checkYears = (year1, year2) => year1 < year2;
const sortYears = array => {
  const sorted = array.sort(checkYears);
  return sorted;
}

const years = [1970, 1999, 1951, 1982, 1963, 2011, 2018, 1922] 

console.log(sortYears(years))

[ 2018, 2011, 1999, 1982, 1970, 1963, 1951, 1922 ]    <- sorted in descending order, everything good

and on my computer using vs code (same code, different output):
const checkYears = (year1, year2) => year1 < year2;

const sortYears = array => {
    const sorted = array.sort(checkYears);
    return sorted;
  }



const years = [1970, 1999, 1951, 1982, 1963, 2011, 2018, 1922]

console.log(sortYears(years))

[
  1970, 1999, 1951,    <- if I just ran the program, nothing is printed, no output 
  1982, 1963, 2011,        if I start running without  debugger than the following sorting is printed,  
  2018, 1922                   it does NOT sorted in descending  order, why?
  ]

can you help me?
Katha:)

Doesn’t matter if the outputs are different, your code is wrong.
If your code was correct it would produce the same results.

The question is:  Why does the same code works on the Codecademy platform and it does not perform on vs code on my computer.
In generell I have problems with running my codes, cause they are just not printed on vs code. But when I select the button run without debugging, the code is printed on the same computer using the same vs code editor. Why?
Is there any advices hot to set up this ■■■■■■■ debugger?
It would be really nice if somebody can help, tanks!

Yeah I saw the question.
But the question is only valid for correct code. Yours isn’t.
So, if you found a bug, and you’re running it in a debugger… great, debug it? And make sure you read documentation for anything you’re not sure about, in this case sorting. If you don’t know how something promises to behave then you can’t meaningfully leverage it until you find that out.

Okay then tell me why the Codecademy platform has no problems to perform my code?
Codecademy does not tell me that my code is wrong

Go read about the sort method you’re using and compare to what you’re doing. If you’re doing X wrong, go google how to do X. You don’t need me to point out what you’re doing differently, because you can go read how it’s done and compare to what you did - that would let you find the difference.
Another thing though, is that you should have noticed that you were guessing how it works when you wrote that code. You have to have some kind of integrity check on your assumptions, and when you’re not sure, go look it up. You need to know how the things you rely on behave.

The gist of what’s happening is that you’re relying on undefined behaviour.
You are using something which isn’t promised to you, all bets are off on what result you get. This is why you get different results, because nobody promised you that it should be any particular outcome.
But if you read documentation for the things you use, and leverage what that promises to you, and this will be the same promise for both environments because it’s the same language, then you will get the same result for both.

these solutions (rules how to sort) are given by codecademy (not my solutions):
sorting in ascending order:
const compareTeeth = (speciesObj1, speciesObj2) => speciesObj1.numTeeth > speciesObj2.numTeeth

sorting in descending order (two possibilities yielding the same result)
const checkYears = (year1, year2) => year1 < year2
const sortYears = arr => arr.sort((x, y) => y - x);

I work in the field of medical imaging/radiology and i want to get into image analysis and interpretation. I have no programming experience until now. I know it is very AI/statistics-related, which skills and languages do you recommend to get into that kind of field?
I started with the Python 3 course since it is recommended for beginners anyways.
Thank you
","
It depends on how in-depth you are planning to go. A number of languages are already have extensions and libraries just for this sort of task.
I’m more than a little biased towards Python so hopefully someone else has a good suggestion to balance things out if nothing else. For getting started unless you have an end goal in mind or someone from your field suggests using something different you could probably just stick to Python. It’s certainly a quick language to get started with (realtively speaking) and has libraries for a whole host of things. I’ve used some degree of image processing, pattern recognition and more general anlysis with Python (scienftic research) and found it realtively straightforward.
If you don’t get a clear cut response here try just searching around on the web. There will inevitably be a few folks who’ve shared their experiences in that field. There may well be more than one good answer and you’ll have to make up your own mind but learning to prgoram in any language will make it signficantly easier to pick up another one in the future should you find it necessary. I’d say most folks use a couple of languages at least even if they have a favourite.

Hi All,
I have been learning the Python language for the last few weeks, and still trying to “get into it”. I am at the Control Flow section after finishing the Functions Courses (the latter parts truly confused me and kinda demotivated me to continue) which I am about to start this afternoon with. Honestly, I am finding it difficult to continue because I am genuinely finding this challenging; it might be because I don’t know what I truly want from this program (Learning on the side or an alternative career), or maybe it is because I do not have a goal to work towards. I have no idea what my end game is, and how to apply this for a personal project.
My general sway of thought would be to create a simple mobile game (like flappy bird for example) - something tangible and something I can be proud of. I don’t even know if Python is the right for this line of thinking. As an extension to a mobile game I would like to branch out into iPhone App Development.
The other demotivating aspect is what I mentioned before that I am finding it challenging to remember all the rules, or to read the theory and practice the exercise. I have this odd thought in my mind that everyone is able to understand functions (or anything really)  first try, and that I am the only one who does not understand certain aspects, and then gets frustrated and too annoyed to watch YouTube clips to get a better understanding of the topic.

Hello @smokey_rasta_sa, welcome to the forums!



 smokey_rasta_sa:

(the latter parts truly confused me and kinda demotivated me to continue)


This completely confused me as well; don’t worry, being confused is normal! The way I got around it was to keep trying to use functions, and think of real-world (actual projects-not just practise) examples of when they might be useful. I got over it, and you will too!



 smokey_rasta_sa:

I have no idea what my end game is, and how to apply this for a personal project.


You don’t necessarily need to know an end game; I started just for fun, but it would help if you set yourself a small project, something like ‘I am going to make a text-based game’, or ‘I am going to make a little program to help me with my daily (something small you wish was automated)’.

This is a good goal to have, and it should be achievable.

Python probably isn’t the best, but don’t worry! Python is the perfect language to learn with, and once you get a handle on Python, any other language (Object Oriented, that is) will come easily.



 smokey_rasta_sa:

The other demotivating aspect is what I mentioned before that I am finding it challenging to remember all the rules, or to read the theory and practice the exercise.


That’s ok; learning a programming language from scratch is hard. Just take your time. If you need to, step back, and take a break. Slow down, and revise lessons, we’ve all been there. A good way to remember things is to revisit each concept and set yourself a really small project (like the instructions in the lessons), even something as simple as ‘make a program that multiplies two number, then adds a third to that result’. Whatever it is, do it on your own (with some help from Google if needed). This is a great way to cement knowledge. Then after you finish, revisit the concept’s lessons, and see if you can make the program better after revisiting the lessons.



 smokey_rasta_sa:

I have this odd thought in my mind that everyone is able to understand functions (or anything really) first try, and that I am the only one who does not understand certain aspects,


That is not true. I got terribly stuck with functions. But keep going, and revisiting.



 smokey_rasta_sa:

and then gets frustrated and too annoyed to watch YouTube clips to get a better understanding of the topic.


If you find yourself getting annoyed, take a break, and go for a walk. Then next time you go to do some coding, start with tutorials and videos about the concepts you’ve just done. Then move on. This will help you cement it.
I hope this helps and happy coding!

Hi @codeneutrino
I really appreciate your message. You usually get these very one sentence like answers that doesn’t really provide you with guidance 
I am going to take your advice by being okay revising sessions (I am going to restart Functions tomorrow followed by a small project post this).
I have a last question (it may be a stupid one but what the ■■■■); is there a Python Console, or program I can create my personal projects with that you recommend?

best answer ever… incredible our paths are so similiar about how its feels to learn to code!

@smokey_rasta_sa, there are a few online compilers that allow you to code in Python, the best one, I would say, is repl.it (https://repl.it/~) It allows you to code in many different languages, definitely including Python!

The modulo operator gives you the remainder. The only works for integers.

var seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

Well, it is see how many seconds are left in the count down. I don’t know how they are doing there but I believe it goes something like:
total seconds % seconds in a minute  = seconds left

Is the lesson specifically for the modulo operation?

No its not, do you recommend i watch videos about the modulo operation?

No, pull the code apart and look at the variables piece by piece. You know what modulo operators are. The problem is understanding everything else around it.

That applies only in the case of some languages. In Python, it also works for floats.

Try Sublime Text 3, and there you can edit (the color, size, etc…) every single type of word use in your code.

Hi guys!
This is my first post here. I’m still a beginner and I know HTML and CSS. I learnt that from Colt Steele’s course The web Developer Bootcamp.
My main goal is making money (even though I like this stuff). But money is the most important thing right?
Another important thing I’m looking for is being my own boss completely (not even a freelancer).
So, these two points are my main goals:
Making money while still being my own boss. Based on this, which one should I go with?

167,How to solve this question?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Given a list of pairs . Each pair contains a food item and its price, for ex: (apple, 120), (banana,200)… and so on. Specific food item may occur multiple times, for ex: (apple,200), (apple,280)… so on.
For each food item output the lowest, highest and average price(rounded down to nearest integer) for that item. The output list should be lexicographically (alphabetically) sorted by name of food.
Input:
first line contains one integer T i.e. no of test cases.
second line contains one integer N i.e. no of pair of fruits
next N line contains pair of fruits.
Output:
Output of result should be in following format:
case #i:
where i is the index of text case, starting from 1. Then for each test case output is one line format :
food item, its lowest price, its highest price, its average price
and output list of food items must be sorted item name in lexicographically order.
Sample Input:

Hi there, and welcome to the forums!
You can do that manually, can’t you? As in, for each of the test cases you could - using a pen and paper - work out which food items you have, what the cheapest cost is, what the highest cost is, and what the average is if there’s more than one.
If you can do it by hand, you understand what the process is for solving the problem. Write out that process as a series of steps - each step should be a single action, ideally - and you’ll find that that sequence of actions looks surprisingly like the objects (variables) and flow structures (loops, if/else) you’ve encountered in code.
At that point, all you need to do is take your “manual” algorithm - the steps you’ve written out - and convert it into a program.

168,What are common values used for margin of error and confidence level?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Question
In the context of this exercise on determining the necessary data during the data science process, what are common values used for margin of error and confidence level?
Answer
Depending on how accurate you wish the data to be, you can essentially choose whatever values you want for margin of error and confidence. However, there is always a tradeoff, as more accurate data requires more work due to a larger sample size needed.
The margin of error determines how much the true value is from what we obtained in our survey. As you increase the margin of error, you will need a smaller sample size, but it will be less accurate, so smaller values are better. Usually, a value of around 5% is used for the margin of error.
The confidence level is used to give the probability that the margin of error contains the true proportion of the population. The larger this value, the more accurate, and “confident”, we can be that the data is closer to the actual population’s. The most common value used for confidence level is 95%. However, 90% and 99% are also commonly used.
","
wouldn’t that mean that the confidence interval is a function of the margin of error? How are they related/different?

One would think that the confidence interval would depend on the sample or population size, not margin of error on any given sample. Without a sufficient population to begin with, margin of error is impossible to compute.

hI! i just want to ask that how could we calculate the sample size?

Thanks!

@armyrobeking Welcome to the forums!
It really depends on what you want to do. If you’re just learning for the fun of it, then I wouldn’t do a skills path or Career path, I would just do individual courses. There are two reasons for this: One, the Paths require Pro Subscription, and Two, they teach and give a very in-depth course on the language, which you might not want to sit through. So, if this is you, and you just want to learn for the fun of it, I would pick a language like Python or Ruby to get to grips with programming concepts (like variables, functions, classes, etc.). Also, if you do want to learn Ruby or Python, you can also learn SQL or HTML on the side, as they are quite different languages, so it is easy to learn side-by-side.
If you do have a particular career/job/language use  (i.e. web development, etc.) then absolutely do a Path, if you want to get a Pro Subscription. This is because the Paths give a greater insight into particular areas of a language, and therefore give you a better chance at getting a job.



 armyrobeking:

I don’t want to spend my time learning a language that isn’t useful, or is “dying”


Don’t worry too much about this, although I do agree, it would feel like a waste of time, but everything you learn can help in some way!
I really hope this helps!

Welcome to Codecademy, @armyrobeking!



 armyrobeking:

I don’t want to spend my time learning a language that isn’t useful, or is “dying”.


This is typically the kind of statement that you’ll see all over in places like Quora. Many, many people are wary of this, and waste more time trying to figure out what to study, than actually studying. And it’s understandable, there’s way too much choice out there.
But as @tera5288723178 said, don’t worry about this. Seriously.
None of the languages taught here are dying. What’s happening, though, is a shift in popularity for some.
Take Python, for example. It’s exploding in popularity right now, and will only keep growing for the foreseeable future. It’s at the top of the “language chain” for now, and will remain there for a while (so a lot of job opportunities, especially considering the wide range of application domains it covers).
But much like Fortran before it, then Pascal, then C, then Java… I suspect it’ll naturally “fall from grace” eventually – being replaced by the latest flavor of the time. This is normal. Does it mean one should avoid learning Python? Absolutely not. Because it will be useful for years to come. And if you’re one day required to learn something new, after years of experience programming in Python, it shouldn’t be too difficult to make the transition to something else. Don’t just fall in love with one language, they’re merely just tools one can used to get the job done. If your tool breaks, you replace it.
Ruby was, a few years ago, quite popular, especially among startups. It seemed as if everyone and their mothers was using Ruby on Rails. Not so much anymore. The fad has passed. And yet, Ruby programmers remain handsomely paid. And it’s still a great language, albeit its obvious limitations.
And then you have languages that aren’t going anywhere… for a long time still. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript –the front-end part of web development– are still required to build User Interfaces, until the day we perhaps have GUIs that’ll replace them entirely. Or a completely revamped web architecture. Not tomorrow, though. So if you want to do web-developement, you can’t go wrong studying those.
SQL, absolutely crucial. You’ll likely deal with databases at one point, so just study it.
Command Line, Git, are important things to know. Learn how they work.
But then again, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to work within the confines of the Apple ecosystem, learn Swift and don’t bother with much else.
If you want to do web development, you have so much choice. You can literally pick anything you want.
Mobile development? Swift, Java, Kotlin, or C#.
Game development? C++ or C#.
Desktop? Probably C++.
Data Science? Python, R, Julia, SQL, Scala.
OS dev? C, or C++.
Web Browser? Probably C++.
Also, learning several tools could make you a better programmer.



 armyrobeking:

What courses would you recommend?


It depends what you want to do. If web dev, start with the basics, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
For other things, it depends.




 ghostlovescore:

Desktop? Probably C++.


Depends on which desktop. If we’re talking development for Windows, C# would be a much better shout these days.
On the topic of “dead” languages… ever heard of COBOL? It’s been around, in one form or another, since the 50’s, and is a pretty popular choice for business programs.
The state of New Jersey is currently looking for COBOL developers to help with some legacy software systems… so I wouldn’t worry too much about “dead” languages. 

Based on the list you wrote about what jumps out to you (near the top of the list): start with Python.  Learn it inside and out!
If you find yourself after some time wanting to be more visual (i.e. website development or game dev) then go to JavaScript.
Knowing both of those languages will give you lots of choices for creativity and careers.
Any language you learn after those, will be much easier because you’ve done the grind of understanding what programing is.
Also, check out (in a relaxed way) the Computer Science intro videos for Harvard.

I would love to learn to code in COBOL. In a perfect world, I would like Codecademy to offer that as a course, but they might have a hard time finding content creators 

Or enough students, in my humble opinion 
This is very niche, I’d never expected to read a post such as yours. Pretty cool, though.
That said, I’m not convinced that this is the best decision to future-proof a career. It might, for legacy reasons and a shortage of COBOL programmers, but we might eventually migrate the COBOL code base to something else. Or not, hard to say.
Another thing to keep in mind is that, for such legacy code base maintenance, I doubt these companies would let a junior COBOL programmer handle this kind of responsibility.
If it’s just to learn one the first programming languages, then absolutely. Pretty cool.

Well, I’ve been in coding (or coding adjacent) for many years. I was in university when Y2K happened, and that was the first time I heard that all this legacy COBOL code was going to end the financial system. Fast forward 20 years, and it seems that nothing has really changed, because although COBOL is rather niche, it is still the optimal language for many large business and financial institutions. I realise that it isn’t sexy like game development, but at this point, I’m thinking of how to upskill myself, particularly for a job where there don’t seem to be a lot of other candidates.

Fair enough, that makes complete sense.
My thinking was that, in an environment such as Codecademy, COBOL might not be the best use of time and resources, as there probably wouldn’t be enough students interested. Although they do offer a Go course, which is still pretty niche in itself. COBOL is something else, though.
But yes, it’d be a pretty cool course to have.
Oh and I made a wrong assumption about your experience (as most users on here are generally getting started, junior-level). My apologies.

No problem at all. I have been teaching coding for eight years (Python, JavaScript, Java, a bit of C), and used to do simulation coding for my physics group in some mixture of FORTRAN, Matlab, and C. Despite that, I’m sure I would be considered a junior-level programmer. I’ve taken a few courses through Codecademy Pro and was trying to figure out how to submit a course request for COBOL.

Check this out: Course Poll
Once in a while they ask the community. That said, since this poll, they added C++, C#, Swift and… Go, at a mere 3%. But not Lua, which came second though.
I think you could start a topic requesting COBOL, and tag Daniel O’Duffy (oduffy).
If the topic gathers enough interest, this could maybe work? Maybe run a poll? I’d vote yes, although I think there are more important courses to add ASAP (like TypeScript, for example).

Hello
I’m new here ^^
I just started my first quiz in the core foundation and I don’t get why the answer the way it is
I’ll share screencaps, plz help me get this
first this one, why is his favorite cookbook, his own book and not the other option, especially after it’s written in the code after the statement “+ my book”
What does that mean?

m1080×704 26.8 KB

sec one this

n1083×716 16 KB

why is the value suddenly 3 when it was 4 once?
Isn’t it saying then that 3=4?
I don’t get what it’s trying to do there?

it was 4, but then at the last line:
numSides = triangle

we update the variable (numsides) with the value stored in triangle variable.

Hello!
What is the statement (3rd line)? It is a string (a text inside the ‘’) + variable.
statement = My favorite cookbook is + X
In the first line we can see that X = another string ( myCookbook = ‘The Joy of Cooking’)
So the statement is the sum of both strings.
Is it clear?

Hello!
There is a difference between = and ===
We we use = we are passing a value to a variable. When we use === we comparing values.
So, in Line 2 we are saying that numSides has now a value of 4
In Line 3 we are saying that triangle has now a value of 3
In Line 4 we are saying that numSides has now the value of triangle (that is 3)
We can say that numSides === 3 now!
Hope I helped! 

Thank you 
You did.

All the options are represented like strings though?
it said, given the value of “myCookbook, (which I’m guessing by the options is ) the joy of cooking”
What is the value of statement? And next to statement you have = ‘my favorite cookbook is’ + myCookbook
which then I guessed that it means the sentence was incomplete and I’m supposed to finished what’s after (is) and before (+ myCookbook )
But since + is there and after it, mycookbook, doesn’t it mean the answer should be ‘how to cook everything’ instead?
I don’t get it

The orange are variables. They are receiving strings (the yellow text) as values.
So, myCookbook receives the string ‘The Joy of Cooking’ (for example A = 1)
and yourCookbook receives the string ‘How to Cook Everything’ (for example B = 2)
the statement is a new variable. Let’s split it in two:
First, statement receives 'My favorite cookbook is ’ (for example C = 3)
And now we are adding another variable to the statement: 'My favorite cookbook is ’ + myCookbook (for example C = 3 + A)
What is the value of myCookbook? It is ‘The Joy of Cooking’ (for example A = 1)
So statement = 'My favorite cookbook is ’ + ‘The Joy of Cooking’ (for example C = 3 + 1)
The sum of 2 strings is a new big string.
So: statement = ‘My favorite cookbook is The Joy of Cooking’ (for example C = 4)

you it should be performing end-the-function for each of them? or something else? if so do the something else instead

","
Hi there.
Both the career path and the skill path pull together lessons from numerous courses on Codecademy to provide a more rounded, guided learning experience focussed on your chosen topic.
The main difference in the web development career path compared to the “Learn How to Build Websites” skill path, aside from being about twice as long, is that the Web Dev path covers every aspect of what’s referred to as “full stack” development.
“Learn How to Build Websites” will teach you how to create a responsive website using HTML and CSS; the Web Development Career Path covers HTML and CSS as well, but also brings in JavaScript, Git, front-end frameworks like React, back-end frameworks like Express, and also some SQL so you can persistently store data.
If you really can’t decide, you could take the “Learn How to Build Websites” skill path first, and test the waters with some HTML and CSS. If you find you’re understanding that well, the lessons you’ve completed during that path will - largely - carry over to the Web Development Career Path, so you’re just “filling in the gaps” so to speak by introducing JavaScript and the other stuff.
Does that help any? 

Yes it does.  Thank you so much!!!

What did you try? Could we see an example?
Please provide a link to the exercise you’re currently stuck on.

Im on the lesson  Make a Website
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/site-structure/exercises/anchor-elements

I eventually had to give up and get the solution but I  still would like to know why the answer was what it was and why was it put in that particular place ,   This is the part i havent been able to catch on to yet and I know this is important if i want to do omputer  programming and web  design

Ok no problem, let’s take it step by step, I’m sure there’s a logical reason as to why this didn’t work.
Do you remember what you tried? Could you show me?
But back to your original question – to anchor text, you’d do it like this:
<a href=""http://www.example.com"">Example Anchor Text</a>
Now that we know that, the exercise wants you to:

Write <p>Here is a list of cities where you can find us.</p>

Add the anchor <p>Here is a <a href=""cities.html"">list</a> of cities where you can find us.</p>


Please note that the Codecademy environment is quite strict to determine if you gave a correct answer or not. You’ll need to concentrate and watch out for a few things. For example, say that you wrote this code correctly, but forgot to add the full-stop at the end of the sentence. Well, you might not pass the exercise. Try to carefully read each instruction, especially when you’re getting error warnings.
You’re just getting started so, don’t worry! In time, you’ll get used to this, and will learn to find your mistakes much quicker and correct them easily. Keep going.

I  dont rightly remember but I dont think I added the  opening and closing

Are there any other exercises   that I could practice doing anchor text maybe until I can get it down properly

Well I don’t know if there will be more in the course you’re currently taking, but it’s likely you’ll have to do it again sometime.
This course https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html also teaches you about it.
But don’t worry, creating links is super easy. You probably just made a silly mistake. It happens, especially when just getting started. Simply remember <a href=""example.html"">Text</a>, and don’t forget to follow the instructions carefully and you should be just fine

What does the image mean when it says computers only have a limited hard-wired knowledge?


And what about how humans communicate through inference, what does that mean?

182,How is this different from the gradient descent for the intercept?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how is the equation for gradient descent of the slope different from the gradient descent of the intercept?
Answer
The main difference between the two is that for the gradient descent for slope, we have an additional factor of x_i for each point of the graph.
The reason for this is due to the derivation of the error function, from which we obtain both gradient descents.
The error function, which we sought to minimize, was as follows:

To obtain the gradient descent for the intercept, we calculate the partial derivative of the error function with respect to b, resulting in:

To obtain the gradient descent for the slope, we calculate the partial derivative of the error function with respect to m instead, resulting in:

which has the additional factor of x_i at each point.
","
Hello,
Why sum of squared error function is divided by N?
By checking gradient descent optimise formula  there is no mention of N.

I believe it is just to normalize the error result. Dividing by N (the number of data points) gives the error total context (i.e. there is this much error per point).
I am by no means a statistician but that would be my best guess.

Hi,

Both, the python3 and the computer science path have a lot in common, am I correct?
I have learned a lot in the python3 course, but I still have the feeling, that I would have to further solidify the python languge concept before I can move on to the data science path.
What is your general recommendation? Rather to deepen knowledge in python further fbefore moving on to data science, or is python3 sufficient enough to be able to master the data science path?
Thank you for your answer

Hello. My understanding is that the data science course starts mostly from scratch, so it will give you a time to consolidate your knowledge. So yes, I think that having done the Python 3 course is more than sufficient for the data science course.

I finally learned how to  build the “Chore Door” project. How close am I to becoming a front end developer considering my progress?
","
Difficult to say, if you completed the project by only looking at the description and completed the project on your own, you are much further along then someone who had to study the hints at each step
From what i hear, some people are capable to land a junior level job between 6 months to a year, but i think in most cases somewhere between a year and two years is more realistic.
The truth is that there is a shortcut in gaining experience. I also think you need to learn at least one front-end framework (vuejs, reactJS, angular).
Maybe not the answer you want to hear.
Anyway, persistence is important. Don’t give up. Good luck!

@jessicav1993, Welcome to the forums! Try removing the full stop at the end of the title. It might work.

In your headings, you are adding extra periods. It should be Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations and NOT Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations. (Notice the period at the end of the heading).  The same goes for the rest of the headings. Don’t add periods to them.

Both @tera5288723178 and @mtrtmk are likely right.
The process which evaluates whether what you’ve written in the learning environment is correct - the “submission correctness test” if you like - can be an infuriating pedant when it comes to having you write exactly what the lesson instructions ask.
If you ever feel like you’re hitting your head against a wall over an error you can’t find in the learning environment, it’s always a good idea to check that what’s given in the instructions is exactly what you’ve written.

187,Is gradient descent only applicable to two dimensions?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Question
In the context of this exercise introducing gradient descent, is gradient descent only applicable to two dimensions?
Answer
No, gradient descent is not limited to two dimensions.
For the models we use in the lesson, we apply it in two dimensions, but it can also apply to three, four, or even an infinite number of dimensions. This is because, in general, gradient descent is used to find the minimum of a function, regardless of how many dimensions it is in.
For an example of gradient descent applied in more than two dimensions, we can picture gradient descent applying to three dimensions, where instead of a curve in two dimensions, we have a sort of topology with hills and valleys. In this case, gradient descent will start at some point on this surface and attempt to find a minimum, going down the hill into a valley or low point.
","
But what could be the equation for that? Or is each time we increase a dimension the equation differ?

dont have explaination for this -2/N

N is for normalizing, and 2 comes when we differentiate the squared error term. If you go through the derivation, you can understand it.

you can find some info in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w
in Calculus we have the gradient vector. This gradient give us the direction in wich your function (n variable function) grows faster. If you multiply it by -1 then you will find the oposite direction (fastest decresing).
Hope that help you.

You could always take a look at REPL.it 

Thank you! I downloaded Sequel Pro for Mac, but it won’t let me use anything without entering a connection or setting up some Socket/SSH connection. I tried using SQL on VS Coder and it also wouldn’t let me do anything without setting up a connection. It keeps prompting me for a Server Name or ADO.NET connection string but I have no idea what any of that stuff is.
I have database files on my computer that I’d like to use (CSV and SQL files), but neither of these lets me directly use those without some Connection Profile. What do I do?

CSV and SQL files can be used to export and import data, the files itself are not a database.
You would need to run a database (like mySQL) and use sequel pro to connect to your database
"
189,Need advice - on a roadblock (Web Dev path),"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Hey there,
It’s my first post here talking about myself. (Man this really became too long of a post. Whoever, reads it, I am buying a beer). I will talk about my experience in doing the Web Development Path. I think it could potentially open up to other people who are also struggling.
Let me say something about my background.
I am a seasoned IT pro. Doing pretty good on the server side, i.e Windows Server, IIS intermediate, Azure Cloud and so on. I’ve always had some fascination for the web technologies and over the years I’ve plunged myself into html, some css and different CMSes, just as a hobby, entertainment. Creating like video games fansites (purely informational, no logic). So as a new year’s resolution I decided to pair my strong IT skills with actual coding skills.
What’s the dream?
Not to work or get a job as a developer but get good enough to … do fun stuff in my spare time. I am a gamer (as much as I can considering family + job). I am a big Diablo fan. Season World of Warcraft player. So the dream is - to create my own browser MMO game. Heavily inspired by Gladiatus, which is an old and dying MMO browser game, which is turn based and is really good.
So 2020 new year’s resolution kicked in and I signed up for Codecademy Pro. When i looked at the Web Development path - Oh boy. Exactly what I wanted. Started with html and CSS. It was really fun because I had some previous experience with html and css so the courses were tremendous fun. Refreshing old knowledge + gaining a ton of new knowledge. I even started rebuilding my old Diablo 2 fansite which I built with WYSISWYG editor back in 2009. Started rebuilding it from scratch with modern knowledge and modern semantics I learn from the course.
Just look at the difference -
2009  - https://www.diablo-2.net/old/
2019/2020 - https://www.diablo-2.net
It was really really great to put all that I am learning in Codecademy and to practice it in something that I love. Knowledge really sticks that way.
So the real programming started with the Javascript modules. Judging by how I was progressing, I think I am not a total dummy for programming languages. However, I had one huge problem with Javascript. I could no longer test it on my diablo website. Everything is printed into the console and no real world application yet. So even though i got an idea of what variables, functions, array and objects are - the knowledge doesn’t stick when i can’t use it. Quickly the new tasks became overwhelming and morale started to go down quickly. I checked the syllabus and I saw that there are lessons for DOM + Javascript soon so that kept me going. I got there eventually and i thought that the sky will open with hope. Unfortunately, it isn’t. The Robot Chore Game was the last draw. Doing it side by side with the YouTube video made me realize that I am so so far away from ever making something like that on my own. I think the Javascript course is really rushed and overwhelms you. I just don’t know well enough what to use and when. Things got a little worse, when I realiased that Javascript is good for manipulating the website and make it interactive but not being a backend language, meant that it has grand issues saving the data that the users manipulate. I basically can’t think of anything cool to build which resets back to normal after a page refresh.
I though about making a character talent tree calculator for Diablo only on Javascript for people to come and test some character builds and leave but that’s light years away from my  current knowledge. I’ve seen some example of such calculators. They use a screenshot of the talent tree from the game and somehow manipualte and create objects on this simple screenshot that are clickable and interactive. If I continue my Web Development path, I might get the knowledge I want but I feel super bad about not being ready even if I get there.
I quickly realised that PHP bundled with Javascript might be the answer for my dream goal - the browser game or at least the interactive Diablo fansite. Creating objects - monsters, that are slain by some sort of a combat system and that they drop items and I want these items to be randomly generated upon drop. I want them to have good tooltips (i think i’ve found the answer to a good tooltip - Bootstrap tooltips).
So now that I am in a Javascript pause to gather myself, I started the Introduction to PHP course. I really dig into the variables and functions and arrays really easy now that I’ve seen the Javascript. It also feels … easier in PHP? … At least for now.
#Question 1 - What do you guys think I should do? Should I focus on PHP or continue my Web Dev path. Can you give me some ideas on how to strengthen my JS knowledge before I continue on the Web Dev path? I found myself using the “give me the solution” button way too often in the end. The whole reason to stop and re-think all this.
#Question 2 - Is there a way to manipulate elements with Javascript and then take those changes and save them (to a MySQL base perhaps) using PHP? That’s ultimately my goal. I think the answer is yes but can you guide me on how? I really wish to learn this to get my spirits up.
","


You need both PHP and JS, although PHP could be substituted by any of the other dozen languages for back-end. You can perfectly learn both at the same time, you might even see similarities  and difference which will help you to become a better developer.


That is certainly possible, there is fetch and axios allowing us to make async request to the back-end of your website, but you also need a database (like mysql)


having a goal in mind can help focus, so its certainly a good thing, but also be realistic, what you want could easily take months, if not more. There will be difficult moments, but those can help you forward.
You just need to keep pushing forward  good luck
to get started with php and mysql, there is xampp to help you on your way 

Thanks. Well i will just push forward.
I am using IIS and MySQL on my PC. Already installed, I just don’t know how to use PHP + MySQL yet. Can you recommend me a course that will cover this? I looked at the Syllabus of my current PHP course and it ends on submitting forms.

xampp bundles it all nicely. Contains database, server and everything. Surely xampp has documentation. I am personally using linux when programming, so not really familiar with the windows environment.

The QUESTION: Does anyone have any advice on free web design tools, frameworks, design advice etc. So i can get the design of my basic website done, and then just build it from the plans. Rather than making it up as I go along.
I hope this makes sense, any help appreciated.

Hi there,
You could sketch your designs using some tools, like

Then you could, or not, use a framework to simplify development.
You don’t need a framework for HTML, but for CSS it could come in handy

Hi, does anybody know how to format a word that repeats in HTML or CSS?  For example, if I have a word “cell” repeated on a web page that I am designing, can I write formatting code once to effect all instances of the word “cell” that come up?
","
Good question. We can wrap the word in question in an inline element such as, <span>cell</span> and then style that element.
span {
    color: darkGreen
}

If we want to find the word in text content, then we need some DOM script to do that. On a specific container it would be fairly straight forward; on a full document it would take some considerable amount of work.

Hi mtf, lets say the word “cell” appears in my website 5 times. I want to cover all of that word using only 1 or 2 lines of code. Is this possible using only HTML5 and CSS3?
Many thanks,
Shane

We cannot select plain text in a document using CSS. It needs a wrapper, which element can be selected.

Ok, is there a way I can use the script tag to help me?

The script tag will not be of much value, but the script it wraps will be where to write the code that will find the words. That script will still need to wrap the words it finds with a span element so a style can be applied.
We must keep in mind that the entire document is plain text, tags, attributes and content. It would be necessary to ensure that we are not targeting tags or attributes, so we would cache the parent element and then search its text node.
If scripting is still not in your skill set, then put this on your future topics list and return to it some time down the road once you have some JS under your belt.

Any guidance on this would be appreciated!
","
What language are these programs written in then?
Well, you would need to build a GUI around your program, bundle all that and make it installable, which is a complicated and long process.
Which is why we have so many websites these days (There is a website for everything), given everyone already has a browser installed. So a lot of “apps” just run in a website.
There are many ways to do what you want, there isn’t one definitive answer to your question

Thanks @stetim94,
My programs were written with Python.
Is there anywhere I can look for a general understanding of this process?
Thank you!

Deploying python is difficult, it means you have to google a lot to find a solution you like, which can be very overwhelming.
Okay, someone made a good summary here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2933/how-can-i-create-a-directly-executable-cross-platform-gui-app-using-python
Seems using Pyinstaller, allowing your code to be deployed cross platform.
Py2exe doesn’t seem to be actively developed anymore
Besides the GUI tools mention (which can help to develop your program), i believe there is also Kivy. Also worth looking into
The alternative is deploy as package, but then it will require command line to install and will mostly be used by other developers.

Or you could use Django to make the back-end of a website, and deploy that. How did i forget that?
No further questions? Its a lot to digest

197,Finished Web Dev Path,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hey everyone,
So, I have been studying for about a year, with Codecademy and other resources. I have finished the web development path and have taken quite a liking to using Node Express.
However, I do not know where to go from here. I am not looking to be job ready for at least another year, but I don’t know how to continue.
I check job forums just to see what is demanded and I see PHP a lot. I feel terrible going back and starting from scratch again with PHP because I spent so much time learning things from CSS flexbox to Node Express.
Where should I go from here? And where should I go so that I can apply what I have learned in further studies?
I feel quite frustrated that after a year of studying, learning, looking up documentation, trying, failing and then succeeding to be in a spot where I don’t know how to continue.
I see a lot of: learn Wordpress and PHP. But, that won’t let me apply what I have learned already… If that is the path, I should I have started with the former and latter a year ago. Or maybe this is indeed what I should do now.
Any help would be great. I love coding and development, I want to switch careers into it next year, but I don’t know where to continue with my current knowledge.
Thank you!

Languages are just tools. It honestly doesn’t matter that much. The more you program, the easier it becomes to learn a new language. You will see many languages share similar concepts.
I would recommend you to build a website, doesn’t matter of the back-end of the website is in nodeJS or PHP, you should build stuff, fail, and learn from it  You will discover that getting projects to run is quite tricky and will teach you a lot.
Start simple (don’t know what you have done already), but give your website login functionality for example
Wordpress is a CMS, can be useful to learn, depends on your interest and goal.

Thanks for the advice. I think, because I really like javascript and node express, I will go back to the React lessons and redo them. I did a MongoDB  online course a mongo uni’s site, so it may be good to focus on React and focus on the MERN stack–as seeing as I grasp the node and mongo quickly. It’s tough reading online all the recommendations of what to learn–just too much to digest at one time.

199,Is it possible for centroids to be generated at the same point?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In this exercise, we learned about the first step in K-Means Clustering, which is the placement of k random centroids for the initial clusters. Is it possible for more than one of these centroids to be generated at the same point?
Answer
Yes, this is possible due to the nature of randomization, but it is very, very unlikely. In some cases, you may even implement the algorithm so that any taken positions cannot be taken by another centroid.
In the rare chance that this does happen, it will not have too much of a consequence. The entire process of K-Means is usually run multiple times, so on different executions, the centroids will initially be placed at different locations. This is done so that it can choose the most accurate of the tests and reduce error.
","
In the same exercise we’re identifying centroids randomly after visualising the data. Since we’re looking at the scatter plot and a couple of clusters are already emerging, why aren’t we using this visual info to determine three centroids manually as our starting points?

Hi there,
In this exercise, they just want to help you imagine the way the algorithm generates random centroids when it runs. We cannot using the visual info to determine three centroids manually as our starting points because all the K-Means process is done by a computer and it cannot see the three clusters as we see 
However, the 3 clusters that we see might be wrong in other circumstances where there are many clusters. We cannot handle the centroids without the calculation power of the computer.
Hope this help

201,Multiple javascript files?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Hi community, I am actually new to web development and coding, recently I try to create a website using html, css and javascript and I have multiple html files but only one css and one javascript file.
Here is my problem, in my javascript file I am getting a DOM element from the second html page and adding a class to it but when I visit my other pages the console shows an error( Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ‘classList’ of null ), the error only disappear when I visit the second html page which is where I grab the DOM from.
index.html
    <body>
        <div class=""index"">
            <h1>Index</h1>
        </div>
        <script src=""./script.js""></script>

about.html

    </body>

script.js
const aboutContainer = document.querySelector('.about');
aboutContainer.classList.add('show');


Am I missing something out in my code or I can’t just use one script file for all my html files?  do I need to give each html their own javascript file?
something like:
index.html  -->  index.js
about.html  -->  about.js
contact.html  -->  contact.js
But what about if I have 10 html files do I also need to create 10 javascript files?
is this the correct way, like creating 5 html pages and also have 5 javascript files?
Thanks
","
Every page runs:
const aboutContainer = document.querySelector('.about');
aboutContainer.classList.add('show');

But because there is only an element with a class of about on the about page aboutContainer won’t have an element on the other pages, so when you try to get classList on it, it will error.

202,Are chatbots Python only?,"Get Help,General Programming",,9,"
I want to build a chatbot, but am not super interested in learning Python. Could I make a chatbot using C++ or something?
","
The question now would be, how well versed are you in C++?

Ummm, OK I guess? I just wanted to know if it was possible 'cause the only section for chatbots on the forums was a Python one.

That may be the only course, but it is not indicative of being the only language. Any language can be used to write a chatbot. Pick the one you are most comfortable with and learn to write APIs.
If we are to assume that you may well be a complete newbie, you might find Python a lot friendlier to learn than C++. That at least would give you some foundation in working with HTTP, database scripting, etc…

I got into C++ because I told my dad that I wanted to make video games, not just play Terraria all day, and he said I could try learning C++. Are you saying that I souldn’t learn C++ or that I should have started with something different?




 teslafox2007:

Are you saying that I souldn’t learn C++?


Not at all. If you are committed  and willing to put in the time then pour yourself into C. It is a steep, uphill climb, though, and probably not the easiest way to learn basic programming concepts. Python is a perfect entry level candidate to start you off. Having that in your pocket will make learning C a smoother prospect.




 mtf:

probably not the easiest way to learn basic programming concepts


I’ve learned JS (sort of) on Khan Academy and done your Basics of programing lesson. Is that enogh? I have also alredy made a Mad Lib game and a Hangman game, and am working on Blackjack, all in C++. I don’t really want to start a new languige right now.

As you are making progress in C++ then that would be the logical choice for where to place  your effort. What is important right now is understanding the syntax, the various constructs such as loops and functions, the range of built-in features offered by the language, and so on. This is not a skill you can acquire in a few lessons, though. It can take years to become super proficient. Stick to small projects and break them down into simple pieces with basic tasks, then thread it together.

Well, if you want a fully function login/register system, then the form is only a small part
the next part would be a database (DB) to store usernames and passwords. Then you would need something to have the front-end (form submission) to your database, often a back-end language is used for this. There are many language (php, golang, python, ruby and more) which can fulfill this task.

hey

which tech should i choose to study? node js or python django/flask?, for full stack
","
If you are looking at a job then in web then, more generally, Javascript will have more options and you would find it easier to move between jobs by maybe picking up a new framework.

JS would be more flexible - there’s a wide range of frameworks written in JS, and you can use it for both front- and back-end development on the web.
Python does have web frameworks which you have already discovered, like Flask and Django. However, to use them on the web you would also need to know HTML/JS/CSS to build the front-end anyway.
I’d say really you have a couple of ways to go here.


Look into Flask or Django a bit more, and see whether you like them. If you do, great - carry on learning them.


Look at web dev jobs in the area you live, or what you consider to be an acceptable commuting distance. If people are hiring for web dev work, they’ll have a list of required skills in the job ad (you’d hope). You can then learn the skills that are in demand, and go from there.


Does that help?

thanks a lot, i study a lot of python, so i wanted to do full stack with python to use it(im doing the computer science path) buy every where its look like JS is more popular,i live i  tel aviv, there is every thing here and a lot of demand but it look like Node JS is th most popular even than i dont understand why…
by the way i love python and will be happy to keep with it,  i think if there was computer science path here with JS i would do it, but it all with python, so i use it a lot( the data structure ect is so good…)
i have another question- years a go i was study a bit .net in high school, and there was a lot of drag and frop options in the ide very easy to use, like you drop every thing you want to a window a program inside the button you drop, today things like this is not popular any more?
and Front page was popular so you didnt had to write html just to drop what you want, why today it doesnt exist?

Since there are many choices, it follows that one might choose something that suits which language they most prefer. That makes it a much easier decision. If Python is your language, then stick with it and perfect the available frameworks so you can make a choice in the end which of them you will go with.
Once you get bored, switch to ES6+ and Node.js/Express.js and when that gets mastered, decide between the two.
After that, learn Ruby and then Ruby On Rails and master that. Now you have three to choose between.
Anybody who has not done this cannot give a truly viable suggestion. You get what I mean…

My friend has homework that she needs to finish before saturday. It involves using john the ripper to crack hashes/passwords.

Any help would be appreciated.

Can you post the code/problem?

Not used John the ripper but from a programming point of view it seems pretty simple.
I’m guessing the hashed passwords didn’t use a salt etc, just a simple hash like SHA2, as this is “homework”.  So it is a case of creating a lookup table from your word list by hashing all the words with the same algorithm and then checking each hashed password against the lookup table, you get a match then you now know what the hashed password is.  If you had salts etc then you could do the same but the salt would mean you couldn’t create a lookup table for all passwords.
Would have thought the program would make it simple to do this.

208,Pushing to a Web Server using NodeJS and MySQL,"Get Help,General Programming",,8,"
Hi everyone
Been working on a project using MySQL and NodeJS and have made a sign-up/login program locally. I was wondering if there were any free programs that supported both MySQL and Node that I could host my server on.
Thanks!
Steven
","
You could look at something like Heroku.
It’s basically a cloud-app focused front-end for AWS, but it supports Node natively for running the app and you can connect to MySQL through an add-on.
You can use it for free, but it’s time limited - if you’re just trying stuff out, it can be useful.
Here’s some info.

Node on Heroku
ClearDB MySQL on Heroku
JawsDB MySQL on Heroku

I use Heroku to run a couple of hobby apps, and I find the free dynos are good for prototyping. 

Is there anyway to use it with out a credit card?  I looked at it, but you can’t add ClearDB or JawsDB without a credit card.

Yes, but you’d need to switch from using MySQL to Postgres.

Oh crap, how different is it from MySQL?

I’m not hugely familiar with MySQL tbh, so I’m not sure.
I’d hazard a guess that, unless you’re doing something real weird in MySQL that your SQL will probably work fine in Postgres. Don’t know how much work would be involved in refactoring your Node application though, as I think you’d need a different library to talk to Postgres?
I’m not sure whether any of the big names in cloud compute have a free offering that doesn’t need some kind of payment method… since the implied caveat is “if you use too much, we’ll bill you” usually. 

Right, but as long as I use the free methods and don’t go over 
Let me research that one for a bit…

Or you could just use any VPS (virtual personal server), this means more manual configuration, but then you can use any database engine you like. (assuming its available on Linux)
There are many VPS:

Maybe not free, but doing some manual configuration before going to tools like heroku is a good idea to improve your understanding of how all this works

Programming is problem solving. Teaching yourself to solve a problem by breaking down the problem into small steps is very important. First solve the problem, then write the code.
Sure, you need to know basic concepts (loop, functions and more), but you will see that many programming languages share these concepts, so once you are familiar with these basic concepts, learning another program language becomes a lot easier
I still regularly consult documentation. Teaching yourself to read documentation and quickly find what you are looking for is really useful. There is simply too much to remember, and sometimes you work in languages/frameworks/libraries you don’t use a lot, then documentation is really useful.
Just keep practicing, make projects to build a portfolio, learn some algorithms (merge and bubble sort for example), be curios, ask questions, keep learning and improving.
hm… i might need to restructure my answer. Hopefully there some good and useful bits in there for you 

Hello! I used to develop Java software professionally. No, you don’t need to memorise everything!
I had a massive Java reference book on my desk. I referred to it very often, when I was looking for a method I hadn’t used before (or often). For example, I’d say “Hmm, I wonder if there’s a method for manipulating strings in this way, or that way…”, and then I’d look up the String chapter to see if there was a method matching what I wanted to do.
I couldn’t memorise every single method! I did find, however, that I did end up remembering the methods I used very often. So, after a while, I consulted my reference book less and less often…
Therefore, the key is to write as much code as possible; do as many projects as possible. Then, as time goes by, you’ll find that you’re memorising your most-commonly used queries without even trying.
I like that you’re printing out the theory and referring to it. This is similar to what I do - as I progress through a lesson, I type handy functions into a Google doc that is open in another tab. In fact, I have two notebooks full of summaries I created when I did a web development intensive last year. I’m so glad I wrote all that, because I recently got back into it, and I read through those notebooks to refresh my memory. I’d be so lost without it!
Good luck with your studies! Once I brush up on my web development skills, I’ll be joining you on the DS path!! 

I have been coding for years. However, I cannot remember everything, even ones that I have used. Sometimes I have to search again for the syntax error, some of them are errors that I searched on the very first day.
Don’t worry if you cannot remember the syntax. Programming is problem solving, not syntax remembering. You can forget the syntax, as it can be easily found on the internet. The important thing is  how you solve the problem (approach, time complexity, variable names…) that makes the program runs efficiently.
Happy coding~!

214,How to convert list to linked list?,"Get Help,General Programming",,67,"
A list and a linked list often look exactly the same, but how can I convert a list to a liked list?
if I have [8,0,5] how do I convert it to [8,0,5] (8 -> 0 -> 5)
class ListNode:
   def __init__(self, x):
             self.val = x
             self.next = None

I know I can use to assignment operator to assign nodes but I need a higher order operation:
list_k = [8,0,5]

linked_list = ListNode(list_k[0])
linked_list.next = ListNode(list_k[1])
linked_list.next.next = ListNode(list_k[2])

But is there a way I can make a linked list so I dont have to assign each node one by one? Can I just take a list and assign the whole thing as linked?
Thanks
","
What operations does your linked list implement? Use those to build it from the python list.
Presumably you’d start out with empty and append each value, no? And depending on how exactly your links work you might want to start either from the front or the back of the list.
And arguably that’s something the linked list’s __init__ should or at least could be doing (but then you would need a class for your linked list, you don’t have that, you only have a class for a node… you could consider a node to be a linked list (this is reasonable) but that would not be the nicest ever interface to expose the list with, so a containing type might be nice)
In particular there’s a clash when creating a list, if a ListNode is a list, then creating a list would be done by calling ListNode but then how do you create a single node … doesn’t entirely add up



 jaccobtw:

Can I just take a list and assign the whole thing as linked?


Uhm. keep in mind that your structure is different from that of a python list. If you keep the whole list then you do not have your structure, so no, that wouldn’t be a linked list would it?

Keep in mind that the purpose of creating a linked list type is to expose operations. It is through them that you would do the conversion. And it is through them that you would use the list. And using a list probably involves creating lists.

The problem is I cant append each value because the given input has a random number of values. So, I need something that can interpret the number of given values and then assign them together to form a linked list. Here is the problem if you wanna see: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/submissions/
I hope my code is not an obstruction




 jaccobtw:

has a random number of values


Uhm. Why would that matter? Append them all. All means each one regardless of amount.

If you make a function that handles a list
then it would be VERY weird to say. yeah it definitely has 5 elements.
You would make use of whatever length the input has, that’s not particularly special.

If a given input has 3 values, I can make code that assigns 3
If it has 4 values, I can make code that assigns  4, but no longer assigns 3 unless I make a ton of conditionals
if the code has 5,000 values, then that would take forever based on my knowledge

Yes but it must account for all inputs simultaneously

Did you know a loop will make one repetition for each value in a list regardless of the length of it?
…
Right? that’s what a loop does.
If you assumed a specific length that would be incredibly wrong, the idea of a list doesn’t have a specific length. Each instance of a list has some specific length and whatever operations you’d ever do on lists would look at the length of the specific list it is currently dealing with and act accordingly.
Look at the sum function.
It sums the numbers of a list.
Regardless of how many numbers that is.
That’s not weird, is it?




 ionatan:

If you assumed a specific length that would be incredibly wrong, a list doesn’t have a specific length


My problem is that I have to assign one node at a time regardless of the list length.

There’s repetition in that, so put the repeated part in a loop.

While whatever:
    add a value to the tail  # also known as append


You can do this with a regular list as well, it too has an append operation.
list.append
so you would start out with empty:
empty = []

Then you’d have some collection of values
stuff = ['teddy', 'banana', 'quilt']

each of which should be dropped into the list one at a time
for thing in stuff:
    empty.append(thing)

# note, no mention of 3


But dont u have to assign each node?
list_k = [8,0,5]

linked_list = ListNode(list_k[0])
linked_list.next = ListNode(list_k[1])
linked_list.next.next = ListNode(list_k[2])



If you have a list, would you create a variable for each value in the list?
No, that’s why you have a list, a container for all of them.
Assignment doesn’t do anything other than creating a variable, there’s no other effect.

I get the append to a list stuff, its just the linked list notation thats difficult

Make an empty list.
figure out how to append a value for it.
Given a list and a value, obtain the list which is the original list with the value included.
That is append. or prepend, depending on how your links work.
append until done.

So a list is already linked?

a python list is not a linked list, no.
a python list doesn’t even expose its structure, it only exposes operations.
you can do things like append, iterate… and so on.
so make yourself an append function, then use that function to repeatedly append to a list

Btw the exercise you linked to doesn’t give you a python list so you shouldn’t be converting.
You should be applying + between two lists, this is map
>>> list(map(add, [1,2,3], [20, 30, 40]))
[21, 32, 43]

but all those lists are linked lists

def_append(list):

215,Is there a way to jump to the end of a line of code to add a semi colon?,"Get Help,General Programming",,6,"
Just started programming and I find it inefficient to have to use my mouse to click to the end of a line or to use the arrow keys to navigate to the end of a line in order to add a ; to the end. Is there a shortcut key(s) to move to the end of a line? Similarly, if I just want to jump passed an apostrophe or outside a bracket is there a way to do so? Thanks!
","
Most code editors probably have something like that, and most of them are very configurable or programmable and would otherwise be able to create such keybindings.
for vim (what I happen to use):
F] go left to next ]
f] go right to next ]
f) (replace the second char with any char to jump to)
; repeat previous movement command
% go to matching brace
Abegin inserting at the end of line
I begin inserting at start of line (after whitespace)
but uh vim’s probably not special other than having simpler keybindings (less use of ctrl/shift/alt) (because insert mode is separate, freeing up lots of keys for keybindings)
vscode is easier to recommend to new programmers and does roughly the same things as vim with a much friendlier learning curve

Uh. Well. to clarify.
Vim solves those problems.
But it doesn’t behave like a “normal” editor.
Its default configuration is very conservative.
It’s difficult to learn, difficult to configure.
vscode doesn’t solve those problems, it uses arrow keys and home/end and lots of ctrl/shift/alt combinations
…and that’s what makes it easier to learn
vscode is also shinier (has gui, vim doesn’t) and easily configured and powerful features are much easier to set up than vim because for vscode you click some button and it magically happens, vim is a bit more hands on.
So the answer to your post is vim… but the answer to vim’s learning curve is vscode.

Does the END key not aid you in your first use case?

Yeah it does the right thing but should your right hand be over home/end or over jkl? It’s kind of silly for something so common.
It still leaves lots of other jump locations. And an editor that uses END probably uses the mouse for various tasks as well, so the right hand has three different places to be, and the left hand similarly needs to do awkward things with ctrl/shift/alt … and you’d probably still not have what vim gives

Does anybody use MSYS2?
I have this page open and ready,

https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-numpy

The thing is it is a TAR file. Where would a person download this file to? A folder in MSYS2? Can the package manager extract the contents for installation?

You can leave out yu to only install that package, but with yu you are also updating your package index and updating everything else.
$ pacman -S --help

You can also install it using pip
$ python3 -m pip install --user numpy
which might or might not require a C compiler (and who knows maybe fortran n stuff) and possibly other build tools

Dumb question,
error: target not found: mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-numpy

Where is it looking for this file? The download location? What about the extraction? I don’t have anything to extract a TAR file.




 mtf:

I don’t have anything to extract a TAR file.


You do, but there’s more to it than that, and it’s pacman’s job
Search first, with $ pacman -Ss numpy
And you may need to do just
$ pacman -Syu
If you did not do so during installation (was part of the instructions)
(which you should do anyway if you haven’t in a while, to keep your system (the part that is msys anyway) up to date)

did that go through? should look like this: https://asciinema.org/a/QPGJiBOuddQ9gQ4jsR4QtnYBB

Once I shut down the shell and opened it again, the update went through to completion and the bash prompt is back. Going to see if I can import numpy…
>>> from numpy import *

so… you never asked pacman to install numpy?

Not specifically, no. Will try that line again…
$ pacman -Syu mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-numpy

don’t need yu options any more, you already did those things
$ pacman -S --help
...
  -u, --sysupgrade     upgrade installed packages (-uu enables downgrades)
...
  -y, --refresh        download fresh package databases from the server

doesn’t make a difference, but you should only be entering things you mean to do, and you don’t mean to do that again

Pop the hood up, find out what’s up.

Were you asked by pacman if you were to replace the python3 package?
If so, you should have said yes.

$ pacman -Qo /usr/bin/python3.exe


The only prompt I ever responded to was to go ahead with installation [Y/n].

$ pacman -Qo /usr/bin/python3.exe
/usr/bin/python3.exe is owned by python 3.7.4-1



Right, so, you have a package named python.
python
just that.
your numpy package depends on this package:
mingw-w64-x86_64-python
installing numpy presumably should have required installing mingw-w64-x86_64-python as well, and presumably that should have conflicted with your “python” package
What is going on there? Don’t know. Don’t use msys.
pacman -R python
this might fail, but if so, what does it say?
and what does pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python
say?

Codecademy used to have its own sandbox but that was long ago. A close approximation of the learning environment can be found at repl.it. For web development, look for the HTML/CSS/JavaScript sandbox, else choose from the range of languages available. You may have to sign up for greater access.

If you try the challenge projects, they give you tasks, but no instructions; you have to complete the tasks they give you, but you don’t get any assistance. As far as I can think, this is the closest to what you want!

exercism.io has a couple of tiny projects that you can complete and submit to human mentors for feedback/discussion
it involves setting up your own environment which could be bit of a hurdle but a worthy exercise in and of itself

I am not going to be in the same server as you if you can solve the problem and then once I thank you, you say somethings that were not appreciated.

Okay, thank you. Where can I find the HTML/CSS/JavaScript sandbox because that is exactly what i’m looking for.

Click the link in my post and sign up for access to the sandbox. Once you get logged in, click New REPL and select HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the list of programming languages.
When it opens up, enter a project name and description and proceed with your coding. Note that there are three files already present in the workspace… index.html, style.css, and script.js. Click each in the left menu to write code as needed.

Okay, yes, thank you. I tried it out without signing up and I’m not a fan because it won’t let me copy/paste.

There is nothing needed to sign up but an email address. If you want a useful sandbox, then sign up.

I use Codecademy to learn everything, although Django is not available, I am sure I can find a course for it somewhere else.

Also, I am enrolled in the Computer Science path and so far I am at 07. Linear Data Structures course, but I find these things with nodes, linked lists, stacks, etc. very complicated and I don’t see how these are useful in Python for web development. I know there are important in programming languages like C++ when you build complex software applications and games, but do you need them for web applications? Python’s built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets seems enough for me.

226,Id and Class in HTML programming,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hello.
Apologies for this newbie question, but I really want to wrap my mind around this concept.
It is my understanding that:
1.) ID is used to define unique items in an element. The ID name can only be used one time only, otherwise conflicts can occur later down the line (i.e certain Javascript/JQ commands not executing etc).
ID can be used with any element.
2.Class can be used to define multiple elements at the same time, therefore you can apply Class and use the same name class multiple times. Class can also be used with any element.
So, here is my question:
Within HTML, both ID and Class are used to define style and behavior with CSS and Javascript which will be applied after the html is written.
But as I am writing my HTML code, how am I supposed to know that I’m going to need to define a certain element with “ID” and a certain element as “Class”? This would require me to know exactly how I want my CSS and my Javascript to interact with my HTML code i.e particular elements, and sections long before I even write my first line of HTML, right? (maybe prototyping is the answer here)
OR
Perhaps my order of operations is wrong?
Maybe best practices for work flow would be to
A.) Write a section of html B.) Style said section, C.) Add behavior to section, D) Repeat . ??
Thank  you so much for the opportunity to ask this question.
Any insight is greatly appreciated.
","
Hello.
I am not entirely sure myself, as I am only about half way through the HTML5 course, however, I would think when writing code, you would build the site using raw HTML only, then, once you saw what it looked like, you would then start to have an idea of where to puts classes and/or ids, in order to make it look better/behave the way you want it to. I hope that helps.

Not necessarily, I usually write out my HTML code with ID’s according to what each section contains. Even though I don’t know what I’m going to with the JavaScript & CSS yet, I do it anyway just because I know that I’ll probably use that section in JS or CSS in some way. Now, I don’t usually use classes just yet cause I like to write out my complete page before starting on the styling, but that’s just my preference.

227,Is HTML considered a programming language?,"Get Help,General Programming",,6,"
Question
Is HTML considered a programming language?
Answer
Some people might argue that HTML is a programming language, but the majority of programmers will say NO, it is not a programming language.
This is because, by its definition, a programming language provides functionality. It does so with a set of syntax and grammatical rules which give instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks like logical tasks, algorithms, loops, and so on.
HTML does not provide these things, which means it is not a programming language. Instead, HTML is specifically a markup language, which does not deal with logic, but with presentation.
","



 jephos249:

which does not deal with logic, but with presentation.


One could argue that “presentation” is not the correct term since by definition, unobtrusive markup contains no presentational elements, only marked up data, which is what HTML is at the core… Raw text data. Presentation and behavior are handed over to the Cascading Style Sheet and DOM script, respectively. This is referred to as, separation of concerns.
Interesting reading…

 A Brief History of Markup by Jeremy Keith


Standard Generalized Markup Language


Hyper Text = Text linked together using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
Markup Language = A language that uses tags to mark or highlight elements in a document.
So by that logic, HTML is a language for linking or tying text documents together to create a branch or web. To me, that certainly indicates HTML is NOT a ‘PROGRAMMING’ language. Once you are comfortable you should move into Python from HTML. That will give you exposure to Web development with markup languages and actual data management/automation with a real programming language. Just my opinion, i’m learning too.

While opinions diverge on this and other topics in programming, I believe the main take-away is to realize the type of assumptions/interpretations under which people will say some specific language could be considered a programming language or not.
This linked video answer, while giving a context under which one could look at HTML as a programming language, gives an overall view on some of the yays and nays of such considerations.


What would be the correct term, rather than presentation? Also is HTML considered a  type of code despite being widely regarded as a MarkUp language, rather than a programming language?




 digital5619860458:

rather than presentation


Structure, comes to mind. Until desktop publishing really evolved, Markup Language was meant to give structure to ordinary text for the purpose of transmission over a network between multiple platforms. The markup was a way that each platform could produce the same output.
A programming language, it is not. There is no logic or real time decision making. It’s a static document that is parsed one time from top down by the rendering engine built into the browser.

That depends, you would need something that is compatible with your app. So depends how your app is build (which tools and languages and so forth), then you would need to see if there is a package which you can integrate in your app.

Do you happen to know of any packages (generally) that some developers have used?  Or examples of apps and what they used?

askismet is really popular for preventing spam for wordpress, not exactly what you look for.
Like i said, its impossible to say, what languages does your app use?
Please provide a bit more information, do you have an existing app? Are you now responsible for maintaining  this app? Its so difficult to answer your question without any additional information.
Is it an android app? Ios app? Hybrid app? Web app? Languages used? There isn’t one magic tool/solution here to solve all of your problems.

React Native and just in development phase of both android and iOS dual app.   There is a website portal that allows the input of information from a person that will display on the app for public viewing.  The input on the website to the app is where the filter is necessary. (vulgar language, incorrect spelling, etc)

there seem to be existing services for this:
https://pusher.com/tutorials/profanity-moderation-react-native-chat
https://getstream.io/blog/filtering-profanity-in-chat-with-react-native/
These seem to have extensive functionality to integrate into your app.
But, as you are developing the app, always consider the pros and cons of using a package or writing the code yourself.
you can also google for additional packages.

232,How do you stay motivated,"Get Help,General Programming",,6,"
I have been coding for only about half a year now. I’m going through the courses and currently learning JavaScript. I’ve learned C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS all to a minor extent to see what I like doing (OOP is definitely easier for me to understand).
I am having the hardest time staying motivated to learn. I feel like I am just failing left and right. It’s either some little syntax error, or a complete failure and misunderstanding of what I am being told to build. I don’t understand the “lingo” used when instructing someone on how to build code. It feels like you have to “know programming to know programming”. Yes it starts you off as if you know nothing… but then I get to that 30-40% mark and its a full stop. From that point on I am constantly having to apply the auto solution just to see how much simpler it is than I am making it out to be. I google the question, I google the errors, and I feel dumb and I feel like I shouldn’t be doing this.
This has been an entire section of JavaScript(Objects) that I honestly cannot say I understand what it was they were teaching me, or why it is even useful? I feel like I can build some pretty complicated and engaging programs using relatively basic programming… and then you get all this advanced stuff that is what you actually SHOULD be using.
Everyone on the forums seems to know what they are talking about, they speak about problems and discuss answers using the exact terms that are confusing to me. I don’t work in the programming field, this is a passion of mine that I only recently have had a chance to explore. So I have a hard time understanding what their problem even is, let alone if it is the same as mine.
Should I just stop? I feel like I am wasting my time and money. If I can’t program at the intermediate to advanced level… why should I even try? I wont be able to get an entry level position with the knowledge I gain from the first 40% of these courses. There are only so many “Hello World” programs you can write before you want to throw your laptop out the window in anger.
","
I’m actually reading a book precisely on how to stay motivated (because I had a similar issue and chose to take a break until I found coding it purposeful again).
Perhaps asking yourself what could the skills you’re learning are gonna help you achieve in the future would be a nice start. What would you like to do that would require those skills?
It is indeed hard and frustrating to not be able to understand the lingo. Even more, it’s disheartening to find very scarce material that would explain it in suuuper easier terms. I had this issue when I was learning about Kernel stuff, so I chose to start constructing my own depictions of what I understood. Basically, started making small comic strips to show things like the ’ memory pool manager’ (obviously a happy lifeguard) or the ‘zombie processes’ (with parents who can’t let go). Later I showed my friends (who were more Kernel experts) and they would give comments like ‘Haha this is funny, but maybe you could also add X because X happens when the manager does this, or this, etc.’
I think it’s important to find those bits of joy, make it more playful for you so that the journey (whether short or long) is enjoyable. Plus, if you have fun, it’s more likely that you’ll start seeing different paths that might be hard to find when we’re frustrated 
Just know that you’re not alone! There are other people with the same struggles. Seeing the autosolution is not bad as long as it helps you understand better  We’ve all done it at some point haha
You can do it!!!

If you want motivation, consider this.  Most professional programmer’s are actually pretty crap.  It’s true, not every programmer needs to be amazing… Infact from what I’ve seen most don’t even need to be average, apparently.  Plus, even if you don’t get a job it can be useful to occasionally whip up a little code to do something for you.
I’ve seen apprentices who have been seen on courses etc, still not know fundamentals after a year.  I’ve meet people who have done computer science courses (with programming and yes I know cs != Programming) who can’t code and are actually pretty weak on the cs side too.
The other thing is, when you have no idea about a subject you have no idea how right or wrong the stuff you are reading is, just because someone sounds like they know what they are doing, doesn’t mean they do.
You’re on your journey, just set yourself goals based on you not everyone around you.  Some people get programming and it’s concepts easily, if you’re not one, no point comparing to them.  If you want to start playing a sport, most people will never get great at it so not point comparing yourself to pros unless you get near them. But that doesn’t mean getting into the sport won’t be fun and maybe have other benefits.
P.s. how can the firey place where to devil lives be censored and crap isn’t?  Only in America!

Programming is difficult, and it can be very tedious. But don’t let that stop you. Sometimes you need to push through barriers to get further.
Experience and practice counts in programming, but even with experience you will keep having syntax errors, but will be better in correcting. Getting satisfaction from solving a problem (a behavioral bug, syntax error, completing a feature) is a massive boost
Even the people here on the forum didn’t grasp all the lingo the first day they picked up programming. That took time and effort.



 brendanporee96297660:

From that point on I am constantly having to apply the auto solution


programming is mostly problem solving, teaching yourself these thinking steps is crucial. I would recommend trying to avoid using the solution button, instead, come to the forum, we can help you by pushing you in the right direction, but then you take the steps. I am personally convinced you learn a lot more from that



 brendanporee96297660:

This has been an entire section of JavaScript(Objects) that I honestly cannot say I understand what it was they were teaching me, or why it is even useful?


This applies to more concepts, but particular classes and objects start to shine once you start with larger projects, it gives us the ability to organize our code very neatly



 brendanporee96297660:

So I have a hard time understanding what their problem even is, let alone if it is the same as mine.


Challenge yourself what there problem is, and if something in that topic can be applied to your code



 brendanporee96297660:

Should I just stop?


no. Programming takes time to learn, i would highly recommend to continue. Learning to program cost time, there is no shortcut in that regard.
Good luck! 

Hey Brendan,

Everyone on the forums seems to know what they are talking about, they speak about problems and discuss answers using the exact terms that are confusing to me. I don’t work in the programming field, this is a passion of mine that I only recently have had a chance to explore. So I have a hard time understanding what their problem even is, let alone if it is the same as mine.

I feel like we are very similar. I have that same frustration of wanting more, and feeling unsatisfied with my progress. I’m new to coding and I want to just drink it in and learn non-stop. This can lead to intense frustration, just because the nature of learning. Specifically with learning languages.
However, I think if this instinct is harnessed it can actually be a very positive quality. Essentially you have an intense desire to know more, and you are frustrated that your learning pace isn’t keeping up with your desire. That’s good! So the first thing I’ll say is that you already motivation, and you have it in heaps.
So the goal, as you’ve pointed out, is to keep that level of desire and drive. For me, it helped to not be so hard on myself. I mean, like you said, you don’t work in the programming field (I don’t either). And you probably know more than 99% of the general non-programming population… That is not too shabby.



 brendanporee96297660:

Should I just stop? I feel like I am wasting my time and money. If I can’t program at the intermediate to advanced level… why should I even try? I wont be able to get an entry level position with the knowledge I gain from the first 40% of these courses. There are only so many “Hello World” programs you can write before you want to throw your laptop out the window in anger.


Like I said above, try to not be so hard on yourself. Learning the foundation is important, and you definitely shouldn’t give up. Sometimes it takes a lot of practice with these more difficult concepts until you gain fluency. It is very much like learning other languages (spanish, italian, etc.), it can be frustrating just getting over the basics when all you want to do is to communicate with the pretty italian girl at the bar and ask her out on a date, but all you can say is “ciao”.
That can be even more frustrating when you are surrounded by people who seem to speak italian fluently. But this coding community is a lot like that pretty italian girl. The motivation to talk to her, and the willingness to try are often more important than your fluency. And if you can keep that motivation and willingness to try, she will teach you the language.

Thank you. That is a really good summary of how I am feeling. I guess I need to take a step back and look at what I’ve done. In 6 months my github is full of programs that I wrote in half a dozen languages. I should use it as an example of my progress instead of how far I have left to go.
I’ll keep going and pushing. I need to remember that it really is learning another language (like a spoken one) and less like copy/paste knowledge.

235,What is done during the storytelling part of the data science process?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what is done during the storytelling part of the data science process?
Answer
The storytelling part of the communicating step can be one of the most important steps because it ultimately serves to make sense of the data. It helps to communicate and explain the data and findings so that team members and others in the company can use that to make better decisions.
Usually, a presentation, like one using Powerpoint, is used to present and summarize the findings and the process taken. These presentations utilize visualizations like graphs and tables to communicate.
Data scientists will share their conclusions drawn from the analysis and modeling of the data, and offer possible answers to questions that were originally made throughout the process. They can also try to provide solutions for problems that a company was facing, and help show what can be done to fix them.
","
This may not be related with coding directly, but I’m just curious, is there any real PowerPoint slides/decks examples here (or somewhere else) that are created and used by professional data scientists to present their visualization and storytelling?

236,Why are there so many different programming languages now?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why are there so many different programming languages now?
Answer
There are many programming languages (several hundred according to Wikipedia) now, mainly because most of them were created to solve or provide some specific need or functionality which other languages at the time did not provide. This resulted in many languages being created over the last few decades to meet many of these needs.
For instance, the JavaScript language, which is quite popular today and used on many websites, was developed by the company Netscape to make web pages more dynamic and to provide a language that would make it easier for web designers and programmers to work together. Another example is the SQL language, which was developed by IBM to provide a query language to be able to manipulate and retrieve data from their databases.
","
The funny is when I’m read at Quora, lots of people who know their own language become the clan and start comparing which language is better, faster and powerful.



 jephos249:

My 2 cents opinion as people have passionate about science and technology suppose embrace all the language.

237,What is the point of id's if there are classes,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
When I’m coding, I often use Id’s and classes. I realized that why should we have id’s when there are classes. I mean, classes do the job of id’s, they can be applied to one or multiple elements. So why have id?
","
once your page grows, having ids for key elements on your page helps a lot for styling
lets say you have you have a navigation menu at left hand side of your page, giving this element an id means we can style all of the nested elements using #left-nav selector
ids are also used to associate labels with input elements, which helps screen readers (a tool for people with poor vision)
ids are also super useful, because there should only be one id per page, fetching the element with JS becomes a lot easier
you will run into some of the things i just mentioned as you continue the course

238,Parsing JSON files and running code on them,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
So I have 3 files from my Spotify data that I downloaded. They each have about 10,000 entries in them. I’ve been trying to go through them and grab certain values from each entry. I’ve created a couple programs like the following:
// Parse file - Default for any loop
let x = document.body.innerText
dta = JSON.parse(x)

// Miliseconds played:
cmplt = 0
for(var i = 0; i < dta.length; i++) {
    cmplt += dta[i].msPlayed
}


What I would like to do is put all of this in a script.js file to run it, but I’m not sure how. I’ve been running it on the built-in console so far, and it’s not very efficient. Does anyone know how to link multiple json files to a JS script file?

239,Stuck at Gitbash(or Git cmd?),"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hello all, I’m at the “Create a Back-End App with Javascript” part of Codecademy, more spefically “Developing Javascript Apps locally”.
The good thing is understand the programming concepts that are thaught so far, the bad thing is I’m stuck with installing Gitbash.
I followed what the author was trying to explain exactly, but when i type in “node -v” in gitbash it doesn’t give me results(show the version of node) like when I do that with windows command. I have removed and reinstalled both node and gitbash and still don’t get the correct results.
Would anyone happen to know what’s causing this problem?
Since I honestly don’t understand much of the next parts of this chapter either, I’m stuck now, so it would be nice to know if there’s a more extensive guide for this matter in another course on Codecademy, since right it feels like I’m just installing random programms on my computer.
","
After another few hours i noticed I got Git cmd(deprecated) installed on my computer aswell: here I can acces node as described in the course, but I when I do for example command “ls” i get the message: “ls” is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
When I acces Gitbash as advised in the course, here I can’t acces node but i can type in ‘ls’ and get results.
Which one is the right one to pick and how do I make it work as it should?

i would use git bash
i use bash on linux, so i don’t know what restrictions git bash has, but you could simple install node using:
sudo apt-get node -y

the node executable should be /usr/bin/node, you could see if its there
its also important to understand that git and bash are two different things, understanding what each is, is a massive help
understanding the difference between bash and cmd also helps

240,Do algorithms always produce the same output given a certain input?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, do algorithms always produce the same output given a certain input?
Answer
No, sometimes an algorithm might produce a different output when given the same input.
This relates to the area of deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms.
A deterministic algorithm will always produce the same output given a certain input. For example, an algorithm to return the largest number of a list will always return the same value given the same input list.
For instance,
greatest_value([1, 2, 3, 4])
will always give us 4 as the output value.
Non-deterministic algorithms can produce a different output given the same input, each time you run such an algorithm. This is usually due to some level of probability or randomness.
","
Please give examples of a non deterministic algorithm like you did for the deterministic one.

The concept of “non deterministic algorithm” is most frequently encountered in computational complexity theory (big - O and all that),  as an algorithm run on a non-deterministic Turing machine (computer), a purely theoretical counterpart to a deterministic Turing machine (the kind you and I are using right now.)  Pursuing the theory leads into considerations of whether there are problems whose solutions cannot be determined in “reasonable” time, despite the fact that any candidate solution could easily be tested once found:  P != NP and beyond.   For more, contact Dr. Google.
In a more practical realm, more-or-less non-deterministic algorithms are used when there inputs we cannot predict. A common example is running a multicore process, where, due to physical constraints, you do not know which processor will finish first.  You can argue that if you only had enough information, the process would be deterministic, and, indeed, that consideration is an important part of the deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machine dichotomy.

I think I get the concept of a non deterministic algorithm, but just to confirm my simple understanding. Are non deterministic algorithms also used in game programming?

241,Choosing an Operating system,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
Apologies if this has been asked before, I searched and didn’t find any topic, mods can move it wherever they see fit.
I use Windows currently for my browsing gaming and general media consumption needs, but I have heard coders don’t prefer windows for programming. I am below average in computer skill, you could call me a cracker, profiting from other people’s work.
I have always had a wish of learning proper programming (that’s why I am here) and I began with python, since codecademy chose it for me, and I have reached the part about git and github where I am thinking of working on real terminal (its satisfying to reproduce the results on a real terminal) and I am confused. Regarding choosing the appropriate operating system.
I have been wanting to make the switch from windows for quite some time but, always I stopped in my tracks, maybe due to the hectic research, or due to the countless distros (versions) of linux available.
If I can get an honest answer, what does codecademy guys think is the best distro for a newb like me to begin with? I keep reading, debian doesn’t come with wifi drivers, mint is not good, even ubuntu was destroyed by utility shell (don’t even know what that is).
Just a few opinions, regarding why is linux better than windows or mac, and which linux is good for beginning. And please don’t ask me to stick to windows, I absolutely want to switch (preferably with dual boot).
Thanks
","
Okay, i will try to give an objective answers (which is not possible), before i can do so i would like to state that: An operating system is just a tool, use the right tool for the job, if i want to develop a windows application (in C# programming language), it would use windows, and i want to develop a IOS application i would use macOS



 vipulkataria93452139:

I keep reading, debian doesn’t come with wifi drivers


debian is mostly for servers, i would NOT recommend it as first linux distro



 vipulkataria93452139:

mint is not good,


have used mint briefly, seemed good. What is wrong with mint?



 vipulkataria93452139:

even ubuntu was destroyed by utility shell


to explain this, we need to take a step back. Where in windows the Desktop Environment (DE) is integrated part of the operating system, this is not the case in linux
From a technical standpoint, linux is just the kernel (the bridge between hardware and software), on top of that we have the DE and other software, which together makes GNU/linux.
couple years ago, ubuntu pushed there own DE (known as unity), but so far i know in the latest LTS release (Long Time Support) they used gnome desktop environment again, so this problem should be gone.
so ubuntu 18.04 should be a fine choice to get started.



 vipulkataria93452139:

Just a few opinions, regarding why is linux better than windows or mac


It isn’t. I do use Linux over Windows, but the pros and cons which make Linux more suitable for me, might not hold true for a lot of other people.



 vipulkataria93452139:

(preferably with dual boot).


dual boot is absolutely recommend, there might be pieces of software which don’t have a (good) linux alternative. Having backups is also highly recommended

Does it make any difference if I use ubuntu, xubuntu or lubuntu?
I have been hearing ubuntu is pushed by one corporation and they do odd antics like amazon search bar?
Nothing wrong with mint (I haven’t even been on linux), just it is hailed as being closest to windows, and I am trying to move away from windows, not get a shadow of windows.
I am getting more inclined towards ubuntu.
My basic purpose is learning as many languages as possible (since I believe in having a strong base), the app development part is so into the future, I haven’t even thought about it.
Could you point a good ubuntu setting up tutorial which allows me to get connected to internet quickly without headaches?




 vipulkataria93452139:

Does it make any difference if I use ubuntu, xubuntu or lubuntu?


this guide seems reasonable:
https://linuxconfig.org/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux#h6-experiment-with-desktop-environments
and like i said, the DE is not part of kernel, this enables us to install multiple desktop environments.



 vipulkataria93452139:

the amazon search bar is easy to uninstall



 vipulkataria93452139:

What is the difference? I came to codecademy it chose python for me, should I have done something different? How to learn programming concepts without learning languages?

No, you shouldn’t do anything different, but don’t get too focused on the syntax of the language. Be aware of the concept

242,Should I use Bootstrap?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Just started learning bootstrap a couple days ago and I can see how useful it is in creating web application at a faster pace then you would creating them from scratch. On the other hand I hear some web developers describe bootstrap as a lazy way of Coding. Should I use bootstrap in my projects? would employers look down on me if I did?

Hey @paine8887!
I think this is mostly up to you but my advice would be to know how to do it in both Bootstrap and normal CSS.
I feel like people would actually be more impressed by you knowing Bootstrap, but if you’re worried about, like I said, I would use predominately bootstrap if you like it better, but be able to use them both interchangeably, just in case.

243,JavaScript IDE,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Hello.
I am looking for an easy JavaScript IDE to use which is downloadable, I don’t want it on my browser and can run JavaScript code.
I currently use Sublime Text 3 but that doesn’t have a console and cannot run code (it can only run HTML files and runs them in my browser).
I’m essentially looking for an official Python 3 IDLE for JavaScript just with a console.
","
The only way I know of to run JavaScript in a standalone environment is Node.js. As for an IDE with a console, I’m not sure one exists. The browser console is likely the best you will find.
HTML-Kit is still available, last I checked, and it has a built in browser for reviewing the work in the editor. I don’t remember if it can run script or not, though.
Ultimately, what you seek will come at a cost, as I doubt anything this robust will be free. It follows that every browser has its own quirks and testing in multiple browsers is status quo if you wish to get a page up on a production server. I rather doubt any one IDE will be able to emulate every browser or device. Again, the console in Chrome or Firefox are likely better than anything else we might find.

I don’t know how easy I would say it is to set up or use, but I use Visual Studio Code. You can download it for free. There is an article here: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/react-development-setup-and-ravenous-part-1/articles/setting-up-node-locally that explains how to set up Node.js. If you are not a pro member, you may not be able to view the article. VS Code has a built in console. You should be able to research (Google) how to install and use a Bash Console and Node.js with VS Code. Good luck!

html & css are front-end, PHP & python are back-end. So either you need to let PHP and python communicate with each other, or write the back-end of your website in python (flask and django are options here).

As @stetim94 said, if you want to build a web application with Python you can use a framework such as Django or Flask.
Django is a framework built to get you up, coding and out to production in as swift a manner as possible. As a result, the Django devs have dealt with a lot of functionality for you already as part of Django - database abstraction, user authentication, session handling etc are all baked in to Django and you just need to leverage it through the framework.
Flask in comparison is a very small, lightweight framework. They provide the essential core services you need to run a web framework, and it’s up to you to either write the code or add in extensions to provide functionality you need.
I personally prefer Django, but that’s not to say that it’s better than Flask (or that Flask is better than Django). They both have their positives and negatives, and suit different purposes like most software.

251,What else might we keep in mind when coming up with a question?,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Question
In the context of this exercise covering the data science process, what else might we keep in mind when coming up with a question?
Answer
In this exercise, it covered a few concepts to keep in mind when coming up with a good question, which include variable relationships, scope, and context.  In addition to these, there are other considerations you might keep in mind.
When coming up with a question, you might want to consider How useful it is. For instance, will answering the question be beneficial in some way to your company, or will it advance some field in science?
Another important concept you might keep in mind is the cost. This includes time, money, manpower, technology, and many other factors that can be costly. If the question is too costly to answer, then it can be necessary to change it.
Furthermore, you might also keep in mind whether the question has been answered already. If it has already been answered, you may need to consider why you are answering it.

I believe the courses coming through the paths are a PRO feature, but this introductory module should be available to anyone (to get people interested in buying the bonus features, I’m sure).
In any case, you can always check the introduction and proceed, as you have, with finding the content for the languages referenced there elsewhere on the website. SQL is the best introduction to Data Science, so you’re on the right track for sure.

Hi @verbannon
My guess would be that when you installed Python 3.8, you didn’t check the box to add Python’s installation locations to the PATH environment variable.

image.png706×449 70.2 KB

I don’t think the box at the bottom (“Add Python 3.8 to PATH”) is checked by default. If you didn’t check this, the installation location for Python won’t have been added to the PATH and this will be causing your issue.
You can fix it by manually adding the installation location for Python to your PATH environment variable. There are instructions on how to do this over on Super User (part of the Stack Exchange network).
Alternatively, if you don’t feel confident tinkering with the environment variables, you can fix the problem by completely uninstalling Python 3.8 before reinstalling it and checking the “Add Python 3.8 to PATH” box during installation.

It’s for executables in packages, those are not placed in python’s installation directory.
Presumably some plugin for vscode is being installed, and that plugin is in turn invoking pip to install half a dozen programs that it’s using for linting and completions and the like.
Depending on how that plugin invokes those programs, they may or may not need to be in $PATH.
Arguably if a shiny button causes warnings then a shiny button should deal with warnings if it cares.
(alternatively, don’t use shiny buttons without being willing to clean up for them, this kind of layering of tools isn’t all that healthy because nobody feels like they’re the layer responsible for anything)

255,Why ever would one want to use the Not operator?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
I’m just wondering why anyone would choose to use a Not operator when as far as I can tell the normal operators can do the same thing.
","
Why not?  It’s simple:
if (!boolvar) {
    //Do stuff if boolvar is false
}

is easier than
if (boolvar) {} else {
    //Do stuff if boolvar is false 
}


I suppose in an actual project it’ll seem like a much bigger deal than a few characters saved.

Let’s consider, for a moment, an example in Python.
Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the interpreter doesn’t know what type a variable is until it’s assigned a value. This is why we simply write myVariable = ""cheese"". Only at the point that the interpreter evaluates that line does Python know that myVariable is a string.
Now, let’s imagine we have written a function which expects to be passed two arguments - one which is a string, and another which is an integer.
def wordsWordsWords(word, repeat):
    return word * repeat

Our function works fine if we provide arguments that are of acceptable types; for example, I can do this:
>>> wordsWordsWords(""Leeds"",3)
'LeedsLeedsLeeds'

or this
>>> wordsWordsWords([""We"",""Will"",""We"",""Will"",""Rock"",""You""],2)
['We', 'Will', 'We', 'Will', 'Rock', 'You', 'We', 'Will', 'We', 'Will', 'Rock', 'You']

but I can’t do this:
>>> wordsWordsWords(""Cool"",24.2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<pyshell#2>"", line 1, in <module>
    wordsWordsWords(""Cool"",24.2)
  File ""spam.py"", line 2, in wordsWordsWords
    return word * repeat
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'

We’ve happily got away with passing unintended data types in to our function until we tried to use a float. If we wanted to restrict our function to only processing the intended string and integer, we can change it as follows:
def wordsWordsWords(word, repeat):
    if not isinstance(word, str) or not isinstance(repeat, int):
        print(""Unexpected types! 'word' (%r) must be str, 'repeat' (%r) must be int!"" % (word,repeat))
        return None
    return word * repeat

Now, if I try and provide an unexpected data type, I get a message telling me I’ve got it wrong instead of my program crashing.
>>> wordsWordsWords(""Cool"",24.2)
Unexpected types! 'word' (Cool) must be str, 'repeat' (24.2) must be int!

Note that, of course, we could do the opposite here. We could just as easily write:
def wordsWordsWords(word, repeat):
    if isinstance(word, str) and isinstance(repeat, int):
        return word * repeat
    else:
        print(""Unexpected types! 'word' (%r) must be str, 'repeat' (%r) must be int!"" % (word,repeat))
        return None

However, in this instance we are working with a relatively trivial example.
If we were working on a larger function, by testing for the affirmative (i.e. if isinstance(word,str) and isinstance(repeat,int)) before proceeding the remainder of our function program is already indented by 8 spaces. If our function itself uses some conditionals or loops etc, we could very well end up with code which has been indented by 12, 16 or more spaces…
Excessively indented code can hamper readability - not to mention that PEP-8 suggests limiting lines of Python code to 72 characters.
By using not, we can quickly determine that the provided arguments are not correct and exit the function gracefully. For arguments of the correct type, the body of our function code is indented only the once and we’ve got more room to write readable Python.
Hope that helps a bit.

256,What should I do next as a programmer?,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
Hello World!
So, I’ve completed a couple of courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript online. All these courses have felt moderately easy to grasp. And trust me I had a really good time learning all the new technologies and concepts. But just after I completed all those lessons and thought about building a project or even writing some simple programs I found myself completely lost and bewildered.
I went through many videos and discussions about the kind of issues I was having. And guess what- I got more confused. Many say that online courses are too easy and made for absolute beginners which even I have come to accept. They suggested diving deep into coding and learning some advanced concepts. Some say that online coding environments are artificial and don’t give a whole lot of real coding experience and that I should code on my computer rather than some flimsy online text editor.
So I thought- okay, I’ve just scratched the surface now and need to go a long way. So I got this book **Eloquent JavaScript** which was highly recommended by the developer community. I went through the lessons and tried to understand each and every concept which I must say is very nicely put together. I completed the second chapter and went straight to the coding sandbox provided on https://eloquentjavascript.net/. And…you guessed it- I failed miserably. I couldn’t figure out a working solution to the very first problem let alone an efficient one. I gave up and looked at the solution which was pretty simple. It hit me really hard.
Now I am not all hopeless and despaired. I still have the same urge and eagerness to learn to code that I began with. I still want to develop some real skills and possibly land a nice job. But I’m just lost. I can’t for the life of me find the reasons I’m unable to connect the dots, correlate the concepts and see the big picture. I just need to know where I might be going wrong in this whole learning process. What do you suggest?
Thank you.
","
This is quite common, and you seem to have a good view on the matter. A codecademy course doesn’t prepare you for a job, being told what to do (codecademy and some other online resources) and doing it yourself are two very different things.
But don’t despair, you just need a next logic step. I suggest something like codewars or codinggame. These give you challenges, from simple to increasingly difficult. And try not to peak at the solution 
or start by making a very simple website (just a header, main content and a footer or something), slowly add some JS (a simple button which displays a alert message for example), and build it from there
you just need to find the right next medium to help you further, persistence and patience. Then you will get there.
or try a small project from udemy, and just fiddle with it. Trail and error can be meaningful.

Thank you for such an amazing answer.
I am already planning to work on some small static web-page projects to get myself started. But do you have some advice on developing problem solving and programming skills. I am for the most part unable to think of a working solution to a given problem. I know all the basics (probably) but can’t figure out how to put it together in order to build an elegant or just a functional program. Any resource for that particular thing will be great.

something like codewars or similar:
https://alternativeto.net/software/codewars/
or like i said, udemy can also be good (video tutorials).


I am for the most part unable to think of a working solution

Actually that’s something I have a hard time believing, because most of the time every-day logic applies. What you might be doing is trying to reason about code before having even figured out what you want the code to do. Figure out what actions should happen first, write it down in plain english if you so want, then start implementing that one small piece at a time until it’s all there.
For problem solving practice I highly recommend adventofcode.com - curated problems in the form of advent calendars (1 problem per day) since 2015 (going again this year!) The two first weeks or so don’t require any special knowledge, it’s more about being willing to dig into it.
exercism.io doesn’t have quite as good of a problem set but lets you ask questions and get feedback on what you wrote which can be very good for improving yourself.

260,Web Safe Font Preview: why won't text input work for font size?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-jquery/projects/font-preview
I am unable to test the keyup handler for the font size text input because the text input field will not accept any changes.  I cannot delete the placeholder text or type anything new in the edit field.  I have tried in both Chrome and Edge.  I tried adding a second text input box to the form and it too was nonfunctional.  The text area for the sample text works fine.  The font size input did not work from the start so it isn’t anything I added  to the project.  Just in case, though, I reset the project and confirmed it still does not work.  What am I missing?
","
OK, I figured it out – you can’t replace or delete the placeholder, you just start typing.  I need to work up to the course where I find out how to give the placeholder a different style so it can be ghosted to indicate it isn’t existing input-field contents.

Try an attribute selector and see if it can be styled.
input[placeholder] {
    color: #aaa;
    font-style: italic;
}

262,Seeking Course Advice,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Hi there! New to Codecademy (I do have Pro Membership). I have never really done coding before yesterday. I’m seeking some advice on which courses I should take. I love playing Minecraft, I’m sure you’ve heard of it. I wanna start learning how to code for Minecraft, possibly just for entertainment purposes, however, It’s a dream of mine to one day work for the company. I know Minecraft uses Java, so yesterday I started the introduction to JavaScript course. I’m already making great progress, I’m enjoying it, and I’m already excited and ready for whats next. Is this a good starting course for learning coding for Minecraft? What courses should I take next? Any tips you could give me to most effectively and efficiently learn coding? Thank you so much for any advice! I already love this community. 
","
Java and JavaScript are different things, but Codecademy does have a Java course.
Writing a (Bukkit/Spigot) plugin is the best way to integrate your new knowledge of coding with your love of Minecraft, as it lets you mess around with code that affects the server it’s run on (you can completely rewrite certain mechanics and add your own (I made Pandas rideable)) without breaking the source of the game.  You can learn more about that here (it says it’s 1.8-1.11 but it works on 1.14 too).

Thank you! So which course should I be taking? The Java or JavaScript one? Also could you elaborate on what makes them different? Is JavaScript used for Minecraft at all and should I start with the Java course first? 

Take Java, because that and JavaScript are very different and you can’t use JS for Minecraft.

There is one line I am confused about-
I initially put sum(numbers) = total but that kept up coming as an error however in the solution it is the other way round : total = sum(numbers)
I don’t understand it. Any help would be appreciated- the error that comes is :SyntaxError: can’t assign to function call
","
The “assign” a value to a variable the syntax has always been:
variable = 'some value'

in your case, you want to assign the result of calling the sum() function to total variable, so total needs to be on the left side of assign operator (=)
Take a close look at the syntax error, it might look scary, but it tells you can’t assign to function call (sum() is a function call)

The syntax manner is the way that without a error . In order to assign any value its written the other way . 
total = sum(numbers) is correct because debugging rules works that ways

266,What are some common things to do when cleaning data?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what are some other things to keep in mind when cleaning data?
Answer
The cleaning data step of the data process can be a very important step because it makes the data organized and usable for the purpose of evaluation and analysis.
When cleaning data, we usually want to make sure to normalize and categorize the data. This reduces redundancy and removes any duplicate or repeated values in the data. This can be done by splitting a table or dataframe into separate tables or dataframes. Pandas includes some useful methods to do this such as dropna() which can remove rows or columns that have NaN or None values.
Furthermore, we can also remove missing or invalid data, if it reasonable to do so, that might otherwise mess up our evaluation of it.

270,TypeError: object() takes no parameters,"Get Help,General Programming",,32,"
I’m trying to do a coding challenge. In this challenge, they start you off with a class set up:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

Given an array of integers, return  indices  of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have  exactly  one solution, and you may not use the  same  element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[ 0 ] + nums[ 1 ] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [ 0 , 1 ].
I’m having trouble setting it up as a class. I understand what I’m supposed to return, but the class format makes it sketchy. I’m not sure if it wants you to create a class object or just set up the function or both.
Thanks
heres a link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

This is not a solution, but it should give you some ideas…
Python 2 code
>>> from itertools import combinations as ncr
>>> class Solution:
	def __init__(self, nums, target):
		self.nums = nums
		self.target = target
	def two_nums(self):
		combs = ncr(self.nums, 2)
		return filter(lambda x: reduce(lambda a, b: a + b == self.target, x), combs)

	
>>> solve = Solution([2, 5, 8, 11, 15], 19)
>>> solve.two_nums()
[(8, 11)]
>>> 

It’s likely overkill and can be simplified. See what you can glean.
Note: In Python 3 reduce is in the functools module.

Further exploration
>>> class Solution:
	def __init__(self, nums, target):
		self.nums = nums
		self.target = target
	def indices(self, x):
		return [self.nums.index(i) for i in x[0]]
	def two_nums(self):
		combs = ncr(self.nums, 2)
		return self.indices(filter(lambda x: reduce(lambda a, b: a + b == self.target, x), combs))

	
>>> solve = Solution([2, 5, 8, 11, 15], 19)
>>> solve.two_nums()
[2, 3]
>>> 


Edit
Got rid of reduce.
>>> class Solution:
	def __init__(self, nums, target):
		self.nums = nums
		self.target = target
	def indices(self, x):
		return [self.nums.index(i) for i in x[0]]
	def match(self, x):
		return x[0] + x[1] == self.target
	def two_nums(self):
		combs = ncr(self.nums, 2)
		return self.indices(filter(self.match, combs))

	
>>> solve = Solution([2, 5, 8, 11, 15], 19)
>>> solve.two_nums()
[2, 3]
>>> 

>>> Solution([2, 5, 8, 11, 15], 19).two_nums()
[2, 3]
>>> 


Edit
BTW, still haven’t followed the link so this is seat of the pants stuff.

Edit
Got rid of the comprehension…
>>> class Solution:
	def __init__(self, nums, target):
		self.nums = nums
		self.target = target
	def indices(self, x):
		return [self.nums.index(x[0]), self.nums.index(x[1])]
	def match(self, x):
		return x[0] + x[1] == self.target
	def two_nums(self):
		combs = ncr(self.nums, 2)
		return self.indices(filter(self.match, combs)[0])

	
>>> Solution([2, 5, 8, 11, 15], 19).two_nums()
[2, 3]
>>> 


Interesting…
>>> class Solution:
	def __init__(self, nums, target):
		self.nums = nums
		self.target = target
		return self.two_nums()
	def indices(self, x):
		return [self.nums.index(x[0]), self.nums.index(x[1])]

 jaccobtw:

Don’t worry about the class. You just need to write the body of the method. You don’t have to define any constructors or properties.
Imagine that you have to create function twoSum(nums, target). This is exactly the same.

@mtf this solution is quadratic in terms of time complexity. I know that you can do better! 




 factoradic:

… quadratic in terms of time complexity. I know that you can do better


I’m curious about this, unable offhand to think of an approach that is not quadratic, at least in the worst-case.  Any hints?

If the target is 7 and you find 3, what would the other one have to be? Is there one?

I was almost done with my elaborate, 3 paragraphs long answer  Thank you, I have much to learn from you!

Was it more or less spoilery? Now I’m curious
Maybe you were just stepping around it a bit more >.>

A bit more, unfortunately. I started explaining that it can be done with two passes or in a single pass through the list. Either way, I definitely prefer your version 




 factoradic:

I know that you can do better!


The instructions specifically stated that no element could be used more than once so I was sure my solution was way out in left field. Didn’t want to give away anything that would dissuade the member from seeking his own solution. Since it was mentioned that he didn’t know how to construct a class my example was more intended for that purpose. Pure silliness on the whole since it clearly broke that one crucial rule mentioned above.

Sorry to be so obtuse, but if I ask the question, is the complement there? (linear), for each item in the list (also linear), is that not n^2 if the item & complement are at the end of the list?




 patrickd314:

if I ask the question, is the complement there? (linear)


Not exactly. You don’t have to check all the elements of the list. You can simply check if you already iterated through the complement. And as you probably know, there are data structures which allow you to check in the constant time if the given value exists in that data structure.

Overall, it is a single pass through the list.
Each time, bind x and i to the current value and its position, and also bind complement to target - x
After that, check whether the complement is in one of the values previously seen. if yes -> done, otherwise -> recurse with the rest of the list, add the current value/position to the seen ones
Directly translated to python it would be O(N) but the Map operations are O(log N) so it’s O(N log N) but that’s fine imo.
python approximation:
seen = {}
for i, x in enumerate(xs):
    complement = target - x
    if complement in seen:
        return (seen[complement], i)
    else:
        seen[x] = i
return None

 factoradic:

they do not appreciate Haskell


Who are these people? I’ve come to quite enjoy haskell! After the few weeks bashing my head trying to think about things differently.

You could also go for a slightly different version. You could use Jonatan’s code but loop only through the numbers from 1 to the target and check if they are in the array, rather than looping through the arrays elements. This would create a program that grows with the target value rather than the length of the array. E.g. You could have an array of one hundred elements but the target value is 3.

But, negative numbers are allowed, right? 




 alexcraig:

that grows with the target value rather than the length of the array


pic or no proof


Ah perhaps I have oversimplified the problem! In a new version I’d the challenge with that limitation then we could use my version.
But these are the sort of challenges I’d love to see in a fortnightly feature. I think the current challenges are perhaps not technical enough to get people really interested and trying novel ideas

On a related note, it’s more helpful if you post the entire error you’re getting rather than just a snippet. For example, if I run your code in a REPL I get the following error:
Main.java:40: error: cannot find symbol
    System.out.println(myDate.Reservation);
                             ^
  symbol:   variable Reservation
  location: variable myDate of type Reservation

I’m guessing that you’re not meant to be trying to print that out? (I don’t know how you’d print that, actually… I know you can print the class variables fine, but that line System.out.println(myDate.Reservation()); has rather confused me…)

Oh boy. LOL I have no clue what I am doing then. Let me go back and read again. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!

No problem, though I could very well be wrong.
I think what the exercise wants you to do is just create some Reservation instances which, when you call the class methods, will go through the different conditional paths like so:
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create instances here
    System.out.println(""Party of five, please!"");
    Reservation partyOfFive = new Reservation(5,10,true);
    partyOfFive.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFive.informUser();
    
    System.out.println(""Party of 10, please!!"");
    Reservation partyOfTen = new Reservation(10,8,true);
    partyOfTen.confirmReservation();
    partyOfTen.informUser();
  }

Console output:
Party of five, please!
Reservation confirmed
Please enjoy your meal!
Party of 10, please!!
Invalid reservation!
Reservation denied
Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.

That’s not an exhaustive list, obviously, but I think that’s what it’s expecting you to do. There’s no “solution”, tbh, as it’s just an exercise of creating instances which take unique paths through your if statements… 

LOL. I’m embarrassed. I am so new. This makes so much more sense than whatever the heck I was doing.
I suppose I am confused about calling methods because I thought I couldn’t call a method that was void?
I definitely need to clear some vocab up for myself before continuing.
Thank you so much for all of your help.  I OWE YOU ONE.

What would be the point? There is already a forum.

Slack, along with other collab tools,  is akin to becoming a common skill for remote dev teams. Forums like this serve a more general purpose. Since most of the people here are headed to join a development community, I am curious if we have one or not. Having one would definitely help us get the feel and be acquainted with the platform.

The Pro members do have a slack channel.

277,What was the main reason of using Python for this course,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
What was the main reason of using Python for this course “Code Foundations”, rather than JS just like in the course “Learn How to Code” ?
","
Hello, and welcome to Codecademy!
I didn’t create it, but I can guess that they want to give you different languages for the basics so you start with a wider range.

I think the Code Foundation Course mainly aims to teach you basic programming concepts without having to think too much about syntax.
Python is one of the easiest to read languages and that helps a lot if you are new to coding and have yet to learn, how a program works (or how your computer will understand what you type in your editor). Additionally it is trending in programming language top lists for its - again -simplicity and versatility.

I haven’t done that particular course, though I will do shortly just to see what I’m talking about, but I imagine that @barelyhere has probably hit the nail on the head.
Python is a remarkably straightforward language to read and create code with, so I’d say it’s ideally placed for getting people to understand the foundational concepts of programming. (Remember BASIC? Python has usurped its place.)

Hello Ekin! This post has a lot of reasons you should learn Python, and then could also encourage Codecademy to use it.




Why learn Python? Python


    Question
Why should I learn Python? Are there any advantages to learning Python over other languages? 
Answer
Python is a great language to learn, whether it’s your first time programming or not, for several reasons: 

It reads like plain English! This is something you can especially appreciate with a side-by-side. Take a look and, without worrying about what these code bits actually do, think about which is harder to read:

// Java
public class HelloWorld {  
  public static void main(String[] …
  



There is no post or anything exempt your words.

The value you want to return needs to be on the same line as the return, or you can use a line continuation character \. However your code as written won’t work even with a line continuation. You’ll need to perform your slices and make your assignment to the final value you want to return, and then return the value.

Your function fails on reverse(“Python!”). It returns “!nohtyP “ when it should return “!nohtyP”.

Not an error, but I presume the Codecademy environment telling you that one of the test cases it’s using to validate that your solution is correct are failing.

If you’re not already in habit of googling things, now’s as good a time as any to start.

I use Visual Studio Code for all frontend web development. It’s lightweight (runs using Electron, which is like a browser app on your desktop), and has a ton of highly used plugins (lots of community support). But keep in mind that it’s first and foremost an editor.
I’m not as familiar with Visual Studio, but I imagine if you are just starting with web, you will be alright without VSC. However, I’d still suggest downloading it. It’s free and easy, and you’ll likely find that many tutorials cater to it.

Question
What if I don’t have a Computer Science degree?
Answer
Having a degree related to Computer Science or STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) definitely helps, but is not an absolute requirement in most Computer Science fields. In fact, it is no longer rare that developers have an unrelated degree or no degree at all, and the number of such developers continues to grow.
However, to enter and succeed in the field without a Computer Science degree, it is important to make sure you learn all the important concepts that would have been covered in the degree and are required for the job. In addition, it can be helpful to make projects, contribute to open source projects, join hackathons, and network with others in the field.

Hi @blog8966734684 welcome to the forum.
Your question, just so it’s also in the thread, is:

In the last line inside for loop, how does “element” initiate itself and how does for loop proceeds further and terminates.plz help

You’ve defined the for loop like so:
for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
    std::cout << element << ""\n"";
}

This type of for declaration in C++ is a range-based for loop.
You’ve already declared, on lines 5-11 of your code (as per your screenshot), the function first_three_multiples(). This takes an int num, and returns a vector<int>.
Let’s take a look at your for loop in more detail.
for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
In this line, you’re declaring a new variable - int element - to take a value of a single item from the range - first_three_multiples(8) - each iteration.
This is where your variable element has been declared, and each iteration of the for loop gives it the appropriate value from the vector returned by first_three_multiples. The variable only exists within the for loop, though - you wouldn’t be able to use the element variable anywhere else without declaring it first outside the loop.
For example, both of the for loops below do the same thing:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> first_three_multiples(int num) {
  std::vector<int> multiples{num, num * 2, num * 3};
  return multiples;
}

int main() {
  
  std::cout << ""Range-based for:\n"";
  for (int element : first_three_multiples(8)) {
    std::cout << element << ""\n"";
  }
  
  std::cout << ""\n\n 'Regular' for:\n"";
  std::vector<int> multiples_of_8 = first_three_multiples(8);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < multiples_of_8.size(); i++) {
    std::cout << multiples_of_8[i] << ""\n"";
  }  
  
}

This produces:
Range-based for:
8
16
24


'Regular' for:
8
16
24

Does that help at all?

thanks for your response…got it.
one more que… it means that range based for loop can only be used in case of vectors?




 blog8966734684:

it means that range based for loop can only be used in case of vectors?


No, you can use a range-based for loop with any type that is a sequence of elements. For example:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string message = ""Hello, world!"";
  for (char c : message) {
    std::cout << c << ""\n"";
  }
  
}

Produces:
H

l

284,Why do we need framework? What's function? :thinking:,"Get Help,General Programming",,7,"
Hye guys! 
I still can’t understand until today, why do we need framework when do coding?
","
Hey @coreblaster65812! The reason people use frameworks is because JavaScript alone can’t perform all the tasks that are wanted. Frameworks are used to give JavaScript those abilities. Just think of it like this. You have a drill. Now, a drill usually comes with the basic screwdriver attachment, and you can do a fair bit with that. But with that alone, is the drill complete? You can get drill bits of all different sizes for the various tasks you’ll need. And frameworks are like those drill bits. There are just some tasks you can’t perform with just the basic drill, but that drill could perform the tasks if you just gave it a couple more attachments.
Sorry if that’s a little bit confusing, I may have gone a little to far with the metaphor 




 coreblaster65812:

why do we need framework when do coding?


we don’t need frameworks, its possible to decide to do a project without frameworks.
however, a framework gives you a lot more pre-made building blocks. This allows more rapid development.
Some frameworks are so massive, that there internal working can be a mystery, and if something goes wrong with the framework it can be a pain to fix.
Just for learning sake, i once build my own ORM and query builder, that was really useful to do, but it takes so long, and then you still have to implement the business logic. If you start with a framework, you can get down to the business logic right away.
so like everything in programming, you have to consider the pros and cons of (not) using a framework.

@stevencopeland Ohh Hye! thanks for the reply. Using that metaphor I can understand it better than before. So, meaning to say here framework help the development more faster? Sorry if i’m confusing you with my language. 

thanks @stetim94 , it’s mean that framework are optional to be use and it helps programmer to develop a software more rapidly. Am I right?

Given a framework gives you a lot more building blocks (abstraction), it should mean more rapid development, but the execution time of the program is probably slower.

Yes, like @stetim94 said, frameworks will speed up development.

286,Script to send input to non-focused window?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
I am curious as to how one would go about coding something that can send inputs (and possibly even interpret outputs) to a window that isn’t focused. I would like to be able to perform tedious repetitive motions automatically on an application, while actually having a different window in focus.
Is it possible? Googling about this has mostly come up empty (surprisingly).
If so, would it be doable with python? If not, what would be the ideal language?
Would running the target application in a virtual machine environment simplify this, by leaving said application in focus inside the VM and running the script from inside the VM?
","
Script can only run in the single namespace that contains it. Cross-site scripting is a security concern that most browsers (if not all) will not allow.
It may be possible if you have a server to act as the middle man. Connect both clients and have them talk to the server. Way over my head, though, so belay, belay if this is mere speculation.

Assuming you mean windows desktop (I imagine pretty much any user of anything else would mention their platform) you’re probably looking for ahk

Yes, it’s for Windows 10. Is AHK able to send inputs to non-focused windows? I’ve used it before briefly but wasn’t aware it could do that.

287,Array with multiple conditions?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
I’m trying to implement a new rule in Stripe that will send fraud to review instead of disputes. I’m trying to add an array with multiple conditions but do not know the correct format for adding more than one condition in an array.
Here is a screenshot of what I’m working on:
https://gyazo.com/d50cbff862e09914c5f70e32d33afbeb
On the left, you can see the rule I started writing.
On the right, under “fraud_type” you can see the list of conditions? (red text) starting with ‘card_never_received’ - which all need to be added as separate conditions in the rule.
Additionally, I thought about making the rule more simple if Stripe would allow it:
Review if :early_fraud_warning: = ‘true’
Not sure if that would work or not - just wanted to get some thoughts /feedback before I went ahead and started messing around with things.
Here’s a link to Stripe’s Rules Reference. It may help make sense of the limits and goals of the rule I’m trying to write:



stripe.com



Rules Reference | Stripe Radar
Online payment processing for internet businesses. Stripe is a suite of payment APIs that powers commerce for businesses of all sizes.





","
It appears you want a rule to review the payment if any of the available fraud types are true. I have zero experience with stripe.com, but one of these rules might work:
Review if :fraud_type

This would trigger a review if :fraud_type has any ‘truthy’ value. I just don’t know if the syntax would be accepted by the Stripe rule maker.
Review if :fraud_type: != ''

This would trigger the review process if the variable :fraud_type has any value other than an empty string. Again, I don’t know what syntax will be accepted.
If neither of those work, you might be able to do this:
Review if :fraud_type = 'card_never_received' or :fraud_type = 'fraudulent_card_application' or :fraud_type = 'made_with_counterfeit_card' or #etc..

In actuality, that last method isn’t much shorter than just typing a separate rule for each possible value of :fraud_type:
Review if :fraud_type = 'card_never_received'
Review if :fraud_type = 'fraudulent_card_application' 
#etc..

Good luck!

That looks like it should all work, which I’m assuming it does. Is this from following the video, or the written instructions, only? Hard to tell by looking with my memory of video (or the instructions) so vague.
At each juncture in the path to developing a finished product are iterations that incorporate newer or differing methods of construction and/or materials.
Take for instance this function…
const playDoor = (door) => {
  numClosedDoors--;
  if(numClosedDoors === 0) {
    gameOver('win');
  }else if (isBot(door)){
    gameOver();
  }
}

First let’s segue to prefixed decrement and suffixed decrement and see how they differ:
x = 3
--x === 0    // false
--x === 0    // false
--x === 0    // true
x = 3
x-- === 0    // false
x-- === 0    // false
x-- === 0    // false
x-- === 0    // true

The reason we are exploring this will become clear in a moment, but first let’s look at the logic of the function above.
To my mind it would make perfect sense to go the shortest route to determining a loss, as opposed to a win.
if (isBot(door)) {
    gameOver()
}

which due to its simplicity, we can write in more expression like form,
if (isBot{door)) gameOver('lose');

Shortest path? Success. It also removes the need for an else clause.
if (--numClosedDoors === 0) gameOver('win');

Using prefixed decrement directly in the conditional combines both operations in a single expression.
Another brief segue that will need to be further researched along the best practices line is default return.
I’ve read (don’t ask me where or when) that all functions should return something, the very least of which is undefined. That is what led JS working groups to create a default return in the first place. But how telling is that return? (Rhetorical question)
In the function above, there is no return unless the result of the latter conditional is false. We can rewire it to return false when gameOver is not called and with a little rewiring of that function, return true.
Bear with me, as this is theoretical, at time of writing.
return --numClosedDoors ? false : gameOver('win');

and to the gameOver function add a final line,
return true;

That return value will travel back to the caller, playDoor and be returned to its caller, one of the doorImage event handlers. Were we to log,
console.log(playDoor(doorImageN));   // N = 1 | 2 | 3

we would see the outcomes in the console with each door click.
Of course this is not productive at all, save for debugging, be we have created a verification process, just the same, and it didn’t take a lot of code, just returns in our functions.
Without changing any other code, ignore the false, and see if this works in your program.
const playDoor = door => {
  return isBot(door) ? gameOver('lose') : 
    --numClosedDoors ? false : gameOver('win')
} 


Before changing anything, can you create a repl of the existing code that one can fork? The image URLs should still work there. That way I can test independent of your code.
If you do not have a profile on repl.it, I’d recommend it as the starting place of sandbox development. Be sure to choose HTML, CSS, JS as the environment (language) so you have all three APIs present.
If the platform will not allow off-domain images, then see if there is a files tab that permits uploads. It will mean having to download the five or so images (all svg) to your computer, and upload from there.

Belay, belay. I have a working version on repl.it that uses images from the CC CDN. No uploads required. It’s still cross domain, though. I wouldn’t count on it always working. But, that’s another thing.
This version is completely refactored and didn’t immediately accept my revised playDoor function, but a tiny revision elsewhere solved that problem.
numClosedDoors = 2

(mind, in my code it’s just, closedDoors). A win in the console would look like this,
 > 
 false
 true
 >

but then so would a loss if the botDoor was clicked on the second try.
By my logic there is no third click.

With further retooling we simplify even more…
  const playDoor = door => isBot(door) ? gameOver('') : --closedDoors ? false : gameOver('win');

290,Sorting,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
i want to sort the list(pizzas) in terms of prices not in terms of topping . when i use the code given below, it sorts the pizzas in terms of topping in alphabetic  order.
the code is given below:
toppings = [""pepperoni"", ""pineapple"", ""cheese"", ""sausage"", ""olives"", ""anchovies"", ""mushrooms""]
prices = [2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]
num_pizzas = len(toppings)
print(""We sell "" +str(num_pizzas)+ "" different kinds of pizza!"")
pizzas = list(zip(toppings, prices))
print(pizzas)
pizzas.sort()
print(pizzas)
cheapest_pizza = pizzas[0]
priciest_pizza = pizzas[-1]
three_cheapest = pizzas[:3]
print(three_cheapest)
num_two_dollar_slices = prices.count(2)
print(num_two_dollar_slices)

","
.sort() can take a key argument, which is used to indicate which key (in this case price) should be used for sorting
https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting

I just looked at the instructions for https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/projects/lens-slice which I believe is the project you are working on. The instructions ask you to zip the lists together with prices first: pizzas = list(zip(prices, toppings)) This would solve your problem because by default the .sort() method sorts a list of tuples by the first element in each tuple. If you’d rather keep your list of pizzas as is you can do this:
pizzas.sort(key = lambda e: e[1])
This will sort the list by the second element of each tuple.

Hey @jeanlaurore101
You have the following code:
// Create a loop
for (decimal i = 0; i<=12; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(""This month you now have $"" + total);
}

Your loop simply outputs the same thing 12 times. Perhaps you ought to be incrementing the value of total each time? 
// Like so:
// Create a loop
for (decimal i = 0; i<=12; i++)
{
  // Add another month of saving to the total here:
  Code to increment the total
  // Write the new total to the console:
  Console.WriteLine(""This month you now have $"" + total);
}

292,What if math is not one's strength?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
I am a desktop support tech who is trying to expand my skill set and thought I’d give code academy a try. I have tried programming here and there over the years and have found it both intimidating and impenetrable. Code academy seemed like a good place to try again. However when i got to the part of the beginning lessons that involved math, I couldn’t go on. I am terrible at math. I mean like almost failing classes bad. It seems like programming involves a great deal of math. Can anyone verify that I will need to know more than basic arithmetic? I was really counting on learning some programming to make more money and now am feeling hopeless and depressed. Maybe I’m wrong. Is there an easier kind of programming out there like web development or Java? Or should I just bail and try to find another skill? It seems like most IT jobs require at least some kind of scripting or programming language skills.
Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Barry

Even I am intimidated by maths, since there is no way I can stand here and discuss Riemann or Fourier or Pascal or even Euclid.
If math is not your strength, perhaps history is . Gloss over math and look at history of Number. Studying along this line will be a road tour through all the real questions that arose through history, and how math was employed to help answer them.
One should not be surprised by how much is learned about math in the process. Now apply that knowledge to application development.
I would only say to keep pressing, and find the connections you can read. Programming isn’t about math but about expression. Some input to the expression results in something out. Will there be math involved? That only depends upon what the program or script is expected to do. It could have nothing to do with math, but position in a list, or node in the DOM.

You shouldn’t be intimidated by math. It’s something you probably weren’t into as a kid - got taught poorly - and haven’t practiced much beyond basic arithmetic and algebra.
It’s normal to struggle with. I know you could improve your skills if you worked at it. Unfortunately  - it is hard work.
All of that being said, you don’t need to know advanced math to learn how to code. You can accomplish so much with programming without a strong math background.
BUT
Computing does all boil down to various maths and applied maths. Understanding advanced math will help you become a better problem solver able to understand the how and why behind the optimal software solution

To mount your site on the web you need a domain, and a host server. If you have neither, then you may have to explore other options such as github (about which I know nothing).

Thank you, Is there any tutorial that you could recommend me that could teach me how to do so? I´m a beginner, sorry

Find a domain registrar in your own country and pay the fee to register a domain for the longest available period (usually up to three years). Once you have a domain then find a host provider in your country, and set up an account.
Hosting providers may bill quarterly, bi-annually or annually. A basic one domain account usually runs from 5 to 10 dollars per month. If you have a credit card or PayPal account payment is generally seamless; you’ll likely get a notice about seven days in advance that a charge is going to be applied.
Use your permanent e-mail address (gmail, etc.) for communicating with your host, not an email address on your domain. That way if your account is ever suspended you don’t lose access to your mail connection with the host.
If the registrar offers privacy protection with your domain (perhaps for a small additional fee) then buy it. It only costs about 15 to 20 dollars a year to keep a domain.
You should know that we do not own our domain, only rent it. That’s why we should take the longest term available. It is necessary for us to know when to renew our domain, or risk losing our right to it.
Be sure to only read notices from your actual Registrar, and not open or read any mail from other domain phishing schemes. Mark them as spam if you get any.
When you get the first email from the Registrar, be sure to mark it, and the sender as Important. In most email clients, we’ll spot our own Registrar by the star by their name, and know for sure that a phishing scam it is not.
Perhaps this is confusing, and one can understand why. Due diligence is our responsibility, not the Registrar, nor the host provider so you will need to read up on all the ways your domain can be exploited, hacked, spoofed, and otherwise misused, more often than not without your knowing.
Search for ICANN and read up all the literature on their site to get a basic understanding of how the domain name system works.
Search for ‘secure my site’ and read up on all the above mentioned threats. I don’t mean to foment fear as much as just stress the importance of being informed and vigilant.
If you can afford it, hire a service to baby-sit your site and alert you to issues (broken links being most common) or suspicious activity. They are likely to be informed of all the typical bots crawling the web, and can identify the friendly ones, and question the nefarious ones. After a year or so you should be informed and aware enough to take over those responsibilities (or not).
All the cautions aside, you will at some point in time have,

a domain and a TLD (example.com)
a host provider
access to your site by secure FTP or otherwise

Try to think of about 50 different possible names, keeping them as short as possible. The Registrar will have a search engine that can check anything we enter and report back whether that domain is available, and on what TLDs.
example  =>  domain
.com     =>  Top Level Domain

Your hostname will be registered as the combination. There can still be others using the same domain on other TLDs. Something to consider when deciding on your domain name. Search for those that have the most TLDs available so there is no clash with other sites.
Registration is an important process and one we want to get right, from the start. The reason I suggest registering your own domain is so you can transfer from one host to another without restriction. Many hosts provide a domain in the account, but that domain cannot be transferred to another host, nor transferred to another individual. You can sell your domain if you control it.
The next step will be propagation of your namespace throughout the DNS so your site is reachable. This process is handled by your host, and may take anywhere from a few hours to a day or so. When you can reach your site in a browser, you’ll know that it’s up and running.
 www.example.com

should open up a home page installed by your host. You want to replace that page quickly, before search engines pick up the signal you just sent by accessing the domain in your browser. The time waiting for propagation is best spent getting the home page and supporting resources (scripts, images, styles) up on the server, and let your home page be the one first seen when that signal is sent.
There you have it. Certainly not the for dummies version, but gleanings from which to harvest. Hopefully we’ve given you a plan of attack.

Addendum
While it is possible to drag and drop an entire site with a smart client, once the site is up it is advisable to disconnect the client and reconnect with your editor. Now access the site and download each page to your editor, one at a time and do a thorough audit. The largest concern is local URLs. They should all be relative to the site root, or their containing folder, not the domain.
'/index.html'

is your site root; and, given how servers default to that page,
'/'

is the site root, regardless whether we name our home page,
 index.htm
 index.html
 index.php
 index.asp
 index. ....

 home.htm
 home.html
 home.php
 ...

Links to your site should only ever be to the domain name, not including the page (resource) name.
http://www.example.com/

Then it doesn’t matter what name is given to your home page.
Of course, if we have a specific page we want to share, then we would use the full resource name, as much as necessary. I like to send links to folders and let the server detect the likely landing page.
 http://www.example.com/photos/birds/

That link will find the landing page of the ‘birds’ folder.
Bottom line, take this first mount process slowly, and get it right, from the start. Less is more, at this point while you sort out all the resource paths within the site. The home page is the most important page of a new domain, so if need be, focus all your attention on that page. Deploy all links back onto the page while you sort this out.
 <a href=""#"">About</a>

Don’t leave it like that for too long (a few days) but better to not have another page breaking while you work on this one. When the About page conforms, then install the URL in the navigation.
 <li><a href=""/about.html"">About</a></li>

Organize your site in ways a search engine will likely expect. images is a folder name they might instantly search for. If you have one, they’ll eat it up. This can help get your images in the index quicker than if the crawlers have to start digging.
A picture that we want to have indexed…
<img src=""/images/index_this_picture_that_I_own.png"" alt=""A picture I took myself of something that has meaning to this page or domain"" width=""100%"">

Any pictures you do not want indexed would be stashed away in a CSS folder.
body {
    background-image: url(skin/my_select_bg_image.png)
}

The above skin folder is inside the css folder. Crawlers are less likely to dig around in here, and there are ways we can keep them out, for real. (Not a concern, just now.)

considering github might be worth it though, given its free.
Here are some guides to help you:

295,Understanding Loop,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Can someone post an example of how a loop can be used in a use case scenario?  I’m having a difficult time grasping/visualizing the “loop” control idea.
","
for (let x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) {
    let y = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

    case y === x: r = 'Bingo!'; break;
    case y < x: r = 'below'; break;
    default: r = 'above'
    }
    console.log(r);
}

This form of loop depends upon iteration. It iterates over the array literal in the of member array. With each iteration, x has new value, and y has a random value in the same range (0…9). We execute the switch in each iteration.
There is also a while loop which does not iterate, but repeats until a condition forces it to terminate. for is supported by an iterator, whereas while is supported by a conditional expression.
do {
    let x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    let y = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

296,Python installation,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Hi guys,
So as a compelte beginer I have started my Python 3 course couple of days ago and just now downloaded and installed Python to work on my computer for the Games of Chance challange.
I have followed the guide: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python3
But I keep on getting error: python: can’t open file ‘code’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory when trying to open mycode.py.
I have tried googling what the reason might be - seems to always come down to typing the code in a wrong folder. I have checked multiple times, also tried opening the cmd window directly from the folder, creating new files and moving them to folder on another hard disk, but I keep on getting the same error…

Hi everyone,
This is the second time I do the Python 2 course.  Now I’m stuck with one exercise, it says it’s unable to connect to Codecademy but the weird thing is when I go back an exercise it is able to connect to Codecademy. Python Syntax 10. Two types of division does work and Python Syntax 11. Multi-line strings doesn’t work.
I already deleted all my cookies etc. and updated my browser but it still doesn’t work.
Does anyone know what I can do it will work?
Thanks a lot in advance,

298,What might I use instead of jquery effects?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Codecademy removed jquery from its web development path (on the day I happened to be working through it; no drama, I’ll finish it anyway!), explaining in their blog post:

…with all the improvements made to JavaScript over the last few years, jQuery is no longer an essential skill for every web developer to have in their skill set.

My question is: are there equivalent effects in JavaScript now (the improvements)? If not, how might I go about adding simple animated transitions to buttons and menus etc. without jQuery? Or is there another reason it’s not useful anymore?
I appreciate that I can still use jQuery; I ask more in terms of understanding current best practice, and learning more about the wider web dev context.
Thanks for your time.
","
For simple animations, jquery can still be good.
However, jquery is in decline given the other niches it used to occupy are gone. Jquery was born in a time, when cross browser support wasn’t good. Jquery solved this. You could make Ajax request with jquery for all browsers, and not having to write code to support all the different browsers
these days, we have better tools (fetch, axios) to make ajax requests, much better frameworks for extensive DOM manipulation (vueJS, reactJS and angular). Javascript now simple works on multiple browsers without having to write extra code.
so i agree with codecademy (jquery is no longer an essential skill), i think this is true, however this doesn’t mean you can’t use it. You just have to consider if jquery is the best fit for what you want to achieve.

Thanks for your prompt and thorough reply. 
That all makes sense. In can see that there’s a whole side of jquery of which I was unaware; I’ve not yet encountered ajax requests and issues of compatibility, nor the libraries you mentioned (though was aware of it all), but I see that I will do down the line.
Many thanks again!

Your indentation is correct. Line 123 in the video appears to be out-dented in a strange position, but that is just an artifact of the editor which had to make an adjustment at the time that the line became too long for the available space. You can see this occurring in the video at approximately 6:25.

Ok. Thanks. Two follow up questions.

Why do I need to have transactions_clean sit outside (less indented) than transactions clean?

I.e.
transaction_clean.append(x.strip())
  transactions_clean.append(transaction_clean)

V.S.
transaction_clean.append(x.strip())
transactions_clean.append(transaction_clean)


Later in the exercise. I am  trying to create a new list that splits items if they contain & and thereby two colors. This list contains no sub-lists so I thought the below solution would work but it does not appear to. T

#My CODE 
thread_sold_split = []

for x in thread_sold:
  if '&' in x == True:
    thread_sold_split.append(x.split('&'))
  else: 
      thread_sold_split.append(x)
  
print(thread_sold_split)


The developers solution uses nested for loops. I can’t see why this is necessary given that the thread_sold list has no nested lists.

thread_sold_split = []

for item in thread_sold:
  for color in item.split('&'):
    thread_sold_split.append(color)

304,Can I jump ahead to JavaScript training?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
I must put more time into Code Academy! I want to complete the course. I am not yet completed with the HTML course. Out of curiosity, can I jump ahead and start training in JavaScript at the same time as I train in HTML and then CSS, or should I wait until I completed the latter?
","
Yes, you can, because the JavaScript course is about the basics of JS and not specified on front-end development.
There is only one part of the course where it’s about Requests so you need to know HTML basics and HTML forms, but not CSS.
Unfortunately the JavaScript course for front-end is a pro course, in this course you would learn about script tags,
<script type=""text/javascript""></script>

the DOM (Document Object Model),
<p id=""test"">I'm testing</p>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
  let test = document.getElementById(""test"");
  test.innerHTML = ""Changed by Javascript"";
</script>

and Handlebars,
<p id=""click"">click me</p>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
  let click = document.getElementById(""click"");
  click.addEventListener(""click"", () => {
    click.innerHTML = ""you clicked me"";
  });
</script>

A click event occurs when you press down the click button on your mouse (the mousedown event), and then you release it (the mouseup event).
Hope this helps 

Thanks for your help. I do have a pro account so I can start that section.

Yes, but you should do the introduction to JavaScript course first then that.

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/python-control-flow/exercises/try-and-except-statements
I’m not understanding how exactly the keyword “raise” is used.


I can’t see the lesson, as I’m not a Pro user, so I don’t know what context around the raise keyword is already provided in the lesson.
What I can explain, however, is that raise is used in Python to raise exceptions. The simplest way I can explain an exception is that they are errors which make themselves known during the execution of your program.
Let’s use a very basic example:
a = 100
b = 10

while b >= 0:
    out = ""One %dth of %d is %d!"" % (b,a,(a/b))
    print(out)
    b = b - 1

print(""Done"")

My simple little program above is just calculating fractions of 100. There are no syntax errors in the program, so Python will happily start executing it like so:
Python 3.6.1 (default, Dec 2015, 13:05:11)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux

One 10th of 100 is 10!
One 9th of 100 is 11!
One 8th of 100 is 12!
One 7th of 100 is 14!
One 6th of 100 is 16!
One 5th of 100 is 20!
One 4th of 100 is 25!
One 3th of 100 is 33!
One 2th of 100 is 50!
One 1th of 100 is 100!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""test.py"", line 5, in <module>
    out = ""One %dth of %d is %d!"" % (b,a,(a/b))
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Here we can see I’m getting a ZeroDivisionError - because my while loop doesn’t stop when the divisor (b) is equal to one. This is an example of an exception.
There are two broad types of exceptions: handled exceptions, which you have anticipated in your code and have written more code to deal with, so they don’t crash your program; and unhandled exceptions, which your program didn’t expect and doesn’t know how to deal with.
In my case, I have an unhandled exception in the form of a ZeroDivisionError.
If we labour the example a little, let’s say I don’t know why this particular snippet of code is complaining about a divide by zero. “There’s nothing wrong with my code”, I say! We can amend it like so to get a clearer picture, since we know what type of error we’re getting back:
a = 100
b = 10

try:
  while b >= 0:
      out = ""One %dth of %d is %d!"" % (b,a,(a/b))
      print(out)
      b = b - 1

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print(""Here is the variable state at time of divide by zero!"")
    out = ""a = %d / b = %d / b >= 0: %r"" % (a,b,(b >= 0))
    print(out)

print(""Done"")

If we run the program again…
Python 3.6.1 (default, Dec 2015, 13:05:11)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux

One 10th of 100 is 10!

One 6th of 100 is 16!
One 5th of 100 is 20!
One 4th of 100 is 25!
One 3th of 100 is 33!
One 2th of 100 is 50!
One 1th of 100 is 100!
Here is the variable state at time of divide by zero!
a = 100 / b = 0 / b >= 0: True
Done

This time, because I have added a try ... except structure and have handled the ZeroDivisionError we don’t get a traceback. Instead, I get the output of my code in the except block which is making it obvious to me that my divisor - the variable b - is equal to zero, and the condition for my while loop - b >= 0 - is still True so the loop will continue with the current variable values.
This is all well and good for a small, simple program like the one I threw together here. Let’s say, though, that you’re working on a much larger project and this code is but a small function within a larger program. You’re confident that your function works correctly, but just in case it doesn’t, we can use the try...except structure to help if we do get an error.
def giveMeFactors(n,nd):
    # n = numerator (e.g. 100)
    # nd = number of divisors to calculate.

    try:
        a = n
        b = nd
    
        while b >= 0:
            out = ""One %dth of %d is %d!"" % (b,a,(a/b))
            print(out)
            b = b - 1
    except:
        # This EXCEPT catches anything, because I haven't specified a type
        print(""Hmm... An unhandled exception was caused by the function 'giveMeFactors'."")
        out = ""n = %r , nd = %r , a = %r , b = %r , b >= 0: %r"" % (n,nd,a,b,(b >= 0))
        print(""Here are the values of all the variables involved..."")
        print(out)
        print(""Throwing exception up the stack!"")
        raise
    print(""Done"")
    
    return None

…and here’s the output…

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The point of the raise keyword here is simple. If you’re working on a big project, you may end up in the position where you have functions calling other functions, which go on to call other functions themselves. What raise lets you do is pass the exception you encountered back up to the code which called the function that triggered the exception. I don’t have an except block capable of handling this exception in the code which called giveMeFactors(), so I have an unhandled exception and Python gives me the expected traceback.
Let’s say I have a function called doMath(), which goes on to call my giveMeFactors() function. What the raise keyword lets me do is say “Oh, ok… giveMeFactors() had a problem. Let’s give that error to doMath(), because that function might know what to do with it!”
Does that make sense?

So, if a function gives an error, “raise” will point to where in the function the error originates.
If the function is called by another function, “raise” will point the error to that other function instead? And if that other function can do something to the error it might correct it?
Sorry, I’m still new at this and am still a bit confused.

raise, when used by itself, says “Show the Traceback (Python-generated error message).”  So, as in @thepitycoder 's example, if raise were not present, once the except clause has printed out it’s message, the function would continue to run (if possible).  However, with raise added, following the execution of the the except clause,  the Traceback is printed and the function halted by the error.
The example used in the lesson, however, is a bit different, and is in my opinion rather cryptic, as no example is given of where you would want to do such a thing:
def raises_value_error():
  raise ValueError  

try:  
  raises_value_error()
except ValueError:
  print(""You raised a ValueError!"")

# Output:
You raised a ValueError!

The fact is, that you can define your own errors as classes (which you’ll get to later in the course), and use raise to call them.  Copy, paste and run the example below, inputting various int values inside or outside of the desired range:
class BadInput(Exception):
    def __init__(self, n):
        print(""Bad input"", n)

def input_stuff():
    x = input(""Input a number from 1 - 10: "")
    if not 1 < int(x) < 10:
        raise BadInput(x)
    return x

print(input_stuff())





 bennylouie1412:

So, if a function gives an error, “raise” will point to where in the function the error originates.


Not quite. Python will, without you needing to write any additional code or use the raise statement, already tell you where it encounters any problems while it’s running your code. That’s what the Traceback is.
raise is there to let you do a few things.


Exceptions are objects in Python, which means that you can create your own exceptions if you want or need to. If you were writing a program, and defined a custom exception, you would use the raise statement to throw that custom exception. Python wouldn’t use your custom exception object otherwise.


You can use raise within except blocks to “pass on” the original exception, in case there’s a suitable hander further up the call stack.


You can use raise to elaborate on exceptions - say you had some exception handling code in an except block, but the code here can’t recover from the error. You can use raise to expand on the original exception, calling an exception from the original exception. Here’s an example:


try:
  print(1 / 0)
except Exception as exc:
  raise RuntimeError(""Something bad happened"") from exc

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 2, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 4, in <module>
RuntimeError: Something bad happened




 bennylouie1412:

If the function is called by another function, “raise” will point the error to that other function instead? And if that other function can do something to the error it might correct it?


If you have a function which contains a try ... except structure, and the except: block contains the statement raise on it’s own, then yes - Python will “pass on” the exception unchanged to whatever code called the function which raised that exception. If the “parent” code has a handler for that exception - that is, an except block that can deal with it - then it will.



 bennylouie1412:

Sorry, I’m still new at this and am still a bit confused.


No need to apologise.  Hopefully we’re not making you more confused with the answers!



 patrickd314:

raise , when used by itself , says “Show the Traceback (Python-generated error message).”


raise on its own re-raises the last occuring exception in the current scope. If you use it on its own without there being an existing exception, you do technically raise an exception in the form of a RuntimeError but this will simply tell you that your raise call was itself the error.

306,Results when using both print and return within a function,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
When defining a function, is there a difference whether I use print() or return?
I’m a little confused as to why sometimes a function will use both print() and return together.
For example:
def lots_of_math(a,b,c,d):
first = a+b
second = c-d
third = first*second
print(first)
print(second)
print(third)
return third%a
Why is not print(third%a)?
","



 bennylouie1412:

is there a difference whether I use print() or return?


Yes, the greatest difference being retention of the return value for further use by the program.
def foo(bar):
    print (bar * 2)

When the function finishes executing, the value of bar * 2 is lost.
def foo(bar):
    return bar * 2

double_bar = foo(21)
print (double_bar)    # 42




 bennylouie1412:

Why is not print(third%a)?


If the intention is to print, and not retain the outcome, then that’s up to the writer. You will find that we use return much more than print in a larger project. Functions are utilities for handling repeated tasks. Often some functions rely on the output of other functions, and the way this is done is with return values being passed back to the caller.

Short answer:

We print() values that we want to see on the screen
We return values that Python needs to use: to assign to a variable, for instance, or to send to another function as an argument.


so if I defined foo(bar) using print, I wouldn’t be able to call back this function later?
In other words, if
def foo(bar):
print (bar * 2)
and bar = 2
the output would =4 only once?
I cannot use the function of foo(bar) again?

We can call a function as many times as we need. That is what makes functions so useful. For each call argument we get a predictable outcome.
Say we have a program that computes the number of 9"" x 9"" tiles we need to cover a given area in square feet…
def tile_count_by_area(width_count, length_count):
    return width_count * length_count

def tile_count_by_length(feet):
    return 12 * feet // 9

room_width_in_feet = 15
room_length_in_feet = 21
width_count = tile_count_by_length(room_width_in_feet)
length_count = tile_count_by_length(room_length_in_feet)

total_tile_count = tile_count_by_area(width_count, length_count)
print (f""{room_width_in_feet} X {room_length_in_feet} needs {total_tile_count} tiles."")

# 15 X 21 needs 560 tiles.

307,Creating website with 3D preview of product,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
I would like to create a website where clients can order custom made nameplates. To make this as attractive as possible, I would very much like if you’d be able to preview the plate in a 3D-like manner (on a brick wall, mailbox, maybe even implemented on a picture of your houses’ facade,…) and also in the different materials we offer (aluminum, ABS, etc…)
What would be the best/easiest way to go about this project ? And what languages/skills would be required ? (considering I’m quite the noob when it comes to website building)
Thanks a lot !

SVG would be a good image format to learn for implementing 3D visualizations. It is easily compatible with HTML, being another XML based format.

308,Why should we make sure that the movie isn't already in our database?,"Get Help,General Programming",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why should we make sure that the movie isn’t already in our database?
Answer
There are a few reasons why we might want to make sure that the movie is not already in our database. One reason is that the movie is already classified, so we don’t want to possibly reclassify it differently or incorrectly than what it really is. And another reason is that this does not give any useful information or new insights, and can cause the model to spend time computing without gaining new knowledge.
","
It would be good to include in the classify() function another argument, the title, called ‘checktitle’  and then make the first lines of the function:
if   checktitle  in dataset:
print (""I;m sorry. The movie "", checktitle, ""is already in the dataset "", dataset)
return
I am a novice, so maybe this code is wrong.

excellent suggestion!

In example 1, every time you return to the ‘for’ statement, the value of the iteration variable is over-written by the next value in line.

The for-loop makes assignments to the variables(s) in the target list. This overwrites all previous assignments to those variables including those made in the suite of the for-loop:

Add a second print() expression:

I am engaged into banking career now and work as analyst in Treasury operations. I am happy with my job and by no means, want to quit it, change it or resign from this career path.
I just review opportunities for me for future to work remotely and mostly from home, but I see that financial sector is not full of such options either…What kind of courses would you be able to advise for me taking into account my banking experience and knowledge?
Would appreciate your suggestions and advice!

You could try Data Science Path.  You’ll learn to manipulate data with SQL and Python. Good luck!

Thank you so much, Stefan, for the comment.
Although I would like to specify that I have heard Data science and python programming both require mathematical skills and solid knowledge of quantities prerequisite…i, Unfortunately, don’t find it as my cup of tea.
Would data analytics be okay for me as well(instead of data science ) or that also includes some mathematical expertise?

Hi,
You could try this (not sure if it is what you’re looking for):
let toCur = 'EUR';

console.log(xhr.response.rates[toCur]);

You’ll have to change the hyperlink too to the currency you want to return, something like this (just an example):
let endPoint;
let toCur = 'EUR';
let fromCur = 'GBP';

function setValues(amount) {
    endPoint = 'https://frankfurter.app/latest?amount=' + amount + '&from=' + fromCur + '&to=' + toCur;

The amount of memory allocated to a data object can vary from one language/system to another. Newer iterations of most languages support 64 bit architecture which greatly expands the size of data objects when compared to 32 bit.

316,Return value of a print() in python,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
I just completed my https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/intro-to-functions/exercises/multiple-return.I began to wonder what would be the return value of print().
When i run this piece of code,I got None as the answer.Can anyone explain why is it so?
b=print(“a”)
OUTPUT: None
","
Every Python function for which there is no specified return value returns the value None.  The function print() is no exception.
print() is a function which does something, but returns None.  What it does is convert the object within its parentheses to a stream of text, then send that stream to a standard output (stdout), usually your console screen.
Your example looks like you meant:
b = print('a')
print(b)
# Output:
a
None

When the first line is executed, as with every assignment statement, the first thing that happens is that the expression to the right of the assignment operator (=) is executed, and its returned value is placed in memory. This is print('a'), and when it is executed, you see a appear on your screen.
Next, the memory address of the value returned by that expression is assigned to the variable on the left.  The value is None and the variable is b, so when we get to the second line, print(b), the value of b is turned into a stream of text and sent to the screen, where we see the text  None appear.

Thank you very much for helping me out.
Is None similar to Void of  C language??Can we consider a function say add_num(None) has no arguments??

Well, we don’t need to type functions in Python, so there’s no equivalent to void f() In Python, you just write def f():, and if f() has no return statement, it returns None.
void (and Null) have some meanings in C with respect to pointers, but in Python, we don’t have pointers, so there’s no analogy there.  Python doesn’t quake at the thought of empty memory addresses.
None is a value, and you can’t define a function with a value as a (positional) parameter.
def f(None):
    pass

# Output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""C:\path\to\test.py"", line 1
    def f(None):
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

You’d get the same error with True, 23 or ‘abc’  as parameters.
You can pass None as an argument:
def f(a):
    print(a)
    
f(None)

# Output
None

317,Python installation editing and execution on Windows,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Hi Guys
I am half way through my Python 3 course. There are two practice projects that I should be able to do. But that requires installing and getting started with Python on my Windows 7 - 64 bit OS.
I have installed Python 3.7 through Python website ‘https://www.python.org/downloads/’. But am having no luck beyond that.
I read that typing Py in my command prompt would let me know if the installation was successful.
1. I opened my command prompt by typing cmd in start menu and hitting enter.
Its file path is c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe - py

image.jpg1366×768 264 KB

**2.**Typed Py and enter.

image.jpg1366×768 189 KB

The message appeared, which according to the installation files meant that it has been successful.
3. I also have Python exe file stored at c:\user\user2\app.data…\python37-32\python.exe
I made a shortcut of this exe file on desktop and when I run it it executes print codes just like cmd window.
But other than that i am having trouble editing or executing functions etc. I am not able to access files or folders using cd, ls commands.

c48cf2f742a1b1b30e7f75c477196202fb5d06af.jpeg1366×768 178 KB

Question 1 -  Which window (cmd or python exe) should I use. What’s the difference between the two other than file path?
**Question 2-**Would they run python programs from the text or code editor. That is i write the code in editor and open file in prompt windows to run it?
**Question 3-**Do I really need these prompt windows for my code. the user interface is depressing and having used codecademy interface I was hoping to set up a UI on similar lines.
Question 4- I read that I need an editor to write my codes and pip to install packages. Will an editor also interpret my code or would I need to install interpreter separately?
Question 5- If cmd and python.exe are the way to go, how do I access the files and folder as every time I try and execute cd - error msg shows up.
I hope your reply will help me understand computer language interpretation better.

You should have IDLE in the installation folder.

Open that Shell, and in the File menu, click New File to open an editor window. You can have as many of them open as you need. Pin this to your Start Menu or the Taskbar.

Thank you.
But i have further questions. Would you please help me with those as well.
How do I integrate these two environment now. The editor and the Python shell ( am I right to call it interpreter?).
I read about spyder and other IDE’s.
Why did no other text on ‘installing and running python’ mentions the idle lib file?
Thank you.

When you shut everything down and go back to Windows, what happens when you click the IDLE shortcut on your desktop? It should open the Shell. That is the interactive interpreter that accepts any Python command at the >>> prompt.
That is the path I use to get to the Editor.
Open Shell
File > New File (editor)

As for where it is mentioned in the installation instructions you have me at a loss. It took me a minute when I first installed Python but once discovered I just made sure to have working shortcuts pinned to the Start Menu and the Taskbar.
I never have more than one Shell application running, but can have multiple editor instances open at once. For my own use, I do not use the Files folder in the Python folder, but have a separate folder in My Documents (and one on my D drive that gets used the most). You may wish to do the same so your installation folder does not contain any of your work and is left essentially OOB.
How you set up your work environment will be up to you.




 mtf:

As for where it is mentioned in the installation instructions you have me at a loss.

I just didn’t know that I needed to access shell shortcut from lib files. Its not mentioned anywhere. This is the first ever programming language I have downloaded and installed, may be that’s why. Thank you for setting me in right direction.

im currently on the html portion of the full stack program and cant complete the final project as i dont know how to create multiple pages in my text editor, or for that matter how to structure my files so as to open them together in my text editor. If anyone could be so kind as to show me how this is accomplished i would be ever so thankful.
","
webpages are just files being rendered by the browsers. A text-editor is capable of opening multiple files (file -> new or file -> open). What text-editor do you use?

hi thanks for the reply, what i mean is that when im using my text editor (atom) i can open a file, but i dont understand how to open two together if that makes sense. also, when im creating files to open i dont know how to structure them or name them so i can open them as two pages together in Atom

not sure if youl get notified if i don’t reply directly to you

Sorry to barge in but do you mean you want to open up two different files at the same time? Or do you want to split the screen?

what i mean is i can create one html page that looks and works fine, but i want to be able to make it so theres two pages or more like a normal website has, like i have my index page but then i want to link to another page like a contact page. this is whats stopping me from finishing the html portion of the class.

so you want two different html pages in your code and you want to know how to link them?
You can link them together by making an <a> tag and linking using the files name
So in index.html:
<a href=""contact.html"">Contacts</a>

If you click this link, it will take you to the contacts.html page if it is in the same folder

yes exactly, i dont understand how to do that. This includes how to name and structure my files so i can open them in Atom. Thank you again i know its hard to understand what im saying since i dint know how to word it properly

So my last post shows how to link them together. Here is how you would create two different files:
So when you start up Atom, you get this:

image.png1299×713 13.1 KB

Go ahead and run Ctrl-N to open up the creation process to a new file
A new untitled file should appear:

a0dbe41e57c4d960339cc5b16526548141de8d6d.png1299×713 13 KB

See? Now I have two open. Now go back to the first one and run Ctrl-S:

76284ec47be06d7b0f9ea7911093298b71154945.png1366×768 73 KB

You should get this screen or something like it. Save the file as Index.html
Once you have done this, repeat the same thing with the other untitled file, this time saving it as contact.html.
Then, copy and paste this code into the index.html file:
<a href=""contact.html"">Contacts</a>

Then, go to your file opener and open index.html. You should get this:

ae5d8ceb78eeb03feaeae8c5b0d65d603eab800f.png1299×741 17.6 KB

If you click that link, you will go to the contact.html page.
Does this explain what you want?

Thank you so much! I think this solves my problem, i have work in a few minutes or id go try it right now. ill give it a go when i get off work tonight! you’re awesome for helping me out.

Awesome! I’m so glad!

Hands up, I don’t know java. But I think - min below might be your problem?
You’ve called Math.round() on it just above this, but not assigned the result to a variable. So perhaps min here is not an integer/long.
In which case you can’t assign the result of this formula to an int; you’ve generated an int with the first part of the expression, but then subtracted min (I think a non-int) from it, thus creating a non-integer.
In any case, Math.round() returns a long, so I’d be tempted to define randomNumber as a long, too.
int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(max - min + 1) - min;





 supern3rd02:

double min = Double.parseDouble(minNumber.getText());
double max = Double.parseDouble(maxNumber.getText());


@antonjw these lines of code take what I put in the text fields I created, and turn them into decimal numbers.

Understood.
But I still think the problem is
int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(max - min + 1) - min;

Because a double is a floating point number. So in the above statement, you’re creating a random integer, then subtracting a double (min) from it, which is going to evaluate to a double (i.e. a number with decimal places); and then you’re attempting to assign that to an int.
I think you’ll need to round min before (so creating or in the above line of code.

I have 2 different rounding lines of code (Math.round(min) and Math.round(max)) these lines round the decimals to the nearest integer

The Math.round() function is returning the result but you’re not storing it - you’re not assigning the result to a variable, so you’ve discarded the rounded result.
Should be something like
minInt = Math.round(min);
maxInt = Math.round(max);

And then use those in your randomNumber expression.
I can’t give you exact syntax though because I don’t know java. But I’m certain you’re passing min & max into your randomNumber assignment as doubles.
See here for correct syntax(es): https://alvinalexander.com/java/how-to-round-float-double-to-int-integer-in-java

    private void randomButtonActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                             
        double min = Double.parseDouble(minNumber.getText());
        double max = Double.parseDouble(maxNumber.getText());
        
        int minInt = Math.round(min);
        int maxInt = Math.round(max);
        
        Random rand = new Random();
        int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(maxInt - minInt + 1) - minInt;
        randomOutput.setText(""Your Random numbers are: "" + randomNumber);
    }                                            


ok, now the lines int minInt = Math.round(min); and int maxInt = Math.round(max); are coimg up errors.
I know you said to do minInt and maxInt without the int, but otherwise it isn’t a variable.
The error message is still the same

ok, looks like you may need to cast the result of Math.round to an int before assigning it to your new int…
try this syntax. any better?
int minInt = (int) Math.round(min);
int maxInt = (int) Math.round(max);

2nd answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2143476/how-to-cast-a-double-to-an-int-in-java-by-rounding-it-down
and last suggestion here: https://alvinalexander.com/java/how-to-round-float-double-to-int-integer-in-java

In class, we aren’t using typecasting (which is the (int))

gotta google things then!
there’s a built-in function on the double that gives you the int value.
Double myDouble = new Double(""32.90"");
int i = myDouble.intValue();


yeah, we’re supposed to use the Math.round(); function though

I hope I don’t get low marks for using that code xD

instead then, switch the ints involved in this to longs.
long minLong = Math.round(min);
long maxLong = Math.round(max);

and
long randomNumber = rand.nextLong(maxLong - minLong + 1) - minLong;

does this work?

This topic is solved.

Hello and welcome on the forums

i dont know what to pick!


That totally depends on you, as a starter I would recommend to start with the Code Foundations Path beacuse they cover how to learn programming and much more, but if you want to get into it I would say to start Web Development path, so you can learn how to create websites and then you could publish your creations and much more, you could even create HTML5 games.

I wouldn’t recommend Data Science path, because that isn’t that much beginner friendly, I know that Codecademy teaches programming and everything very well, and they also teach python and SQL there but I wouldn’t start with that, but you can definitely get back to it when you have some experience in programming, but this is only my opinion about it so if you would like to start with it then you can because you would learn python and SQL at the beginning which would definitely help.

325,Are there different categories in Web Development?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
Are there different categories in Web Development?
Answer
Yes, in Web Development there are three main categories which are Front-end, Back-end, and Full-stack Web Development.
Front-end
This category mainly deals with the presentation and design of a website and includes concepts such as user interaction and experience. Some of the most commonly used languages for this category are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Back-end
Back-end development deals mainly with what goes on “behind the scenes” of a website or web application, such as the databases, servers, and logical components. These are usually not part of the presentation or visible to users. One common language used for back-end development is SQL, which works with databases.
Full-stack
Full-stack Web Development is a combination of both Front-end and Back-end development. It deals with the entire ‘stack’ of tasks and technologies in the development process.

I also suggest CSS next, as @trevorhodges suggests. After that, I suggest learning C++. It is different than web languages, but it is powerful, and being a developer, C++ is a good tool to be able to use fluently.

CSS basics and then Bootstrap. Aligning items on a page with CSS is a royal pain. Bootstrap or Bootstrap themes save you time and hassle.

Question
In this exercise, it shows us a Venn diagram showing how Mathematics, Computer Science and Domain Expertise come together to form data science.
Do I need an equal level of expertise in each of these parts of data science?
Answer
Not necessarily.
Although the diagram appears to show three equally sized circles, this is not meant to imply an equal amount of expertise required in each part of data science. If each circle was scaled accurately to reflect expertise, more than likely each circle will have different sizes, because most people will have a proclivity skewed toward one or two of the parts.
However, to be successful in the field, one should definitely have at least a good grasp of each of the fundamental concepts of Mathematics and Computer Science, and ideally some Domain Expertise in a particular field.

You need: Domain, Hosting & your website files !
What is a domain ? Domain is the URL / website address something.com ( or any other extension, it doesn’t have to be .com )
What is hosting ?  A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web.
A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed on the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers.
Do I need to buy hosting & domain from the same company ? Nope, You can look around find someone who is cheap and reliable.
Buying hosting
~ Look for an affordable & reputable company local in your country or international (your choice)
~ Make sure company has good support
~ Buy shared hosting for starters 
Buying a domain
~ Find an affordable & reputable registrar
~ Choose a domain name (remember you cannot change it, you will have to purchase another one)
~ Enter in nameserver
What is a nameserver ?


en.wikipedia.org


Name server
A name server is a computer application that implements a network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service. It translates an often humanly meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This service is performed by the server in response to a service protocol request.
 An example of a name server is the server component of the Domain Name System (DNS), one of the two principal namespaces of the Internet. ...





Short simple explanation is: Nameserver directs the domain to your hosting server, gets your data so it can be displayed on the World Wide Web
You can get your nameserver from your host. Nameservers can be changed on your domain so if you decide to change host…
If you are buying hosting and domain from the same company then they will most likely set this up for you.
Once I have bought hosting & domain how do I set it up ?
Your host is most likely to provide you with a cPanel or any other control panel.
If you have given your host your domain name when purchasing domain then they will have it setup on your control panel and all you need to do is upload the files.
File manager - click on your website address -  upload your website files
Remember index.html / index.php will be displayed as your landing page
Don’t forget to link up all your files & media
When buying hosting & domains the company will most likely try to sell you tons of add-on’s be careful it just makes your bill bigger and most likely not necessary.

[details=Read more]
Domain Name Server (DNS)
Each computer on the Internet is assigned a unique address, called an IP address. A typical IP address looks like this: 199.123.456.7 
It is very difficult to keep in mind the IP addresses of all the websites we visit daily. Words are easier to remember than strings of numbers. This is where domain names come into the picture. When you visit a website, all you need to know is its URL. Computers remember numbers, and DNS helps us convert the URL into an IP address that the computer can understand.
When you type in domain.com into your browser, the browser first needs to get the IP address of www.domain.com. The browser contacts a DNS server to query the location of the server where the webpages are stored. Think of it as a directory service of IP address.
The classic phonebook directory analogy, you need to find the company “Joe’s Bookstore”, you look in the directory and see that it is located on 123 Main Street. Then you go to the address to visit the store.
-website.com
Types of Web Hosting Services
There are various types of web hosting services available to host your website. Before signing up for web hosting services, it is important to understand what kind of service your website needs, the kind of server you or your business needs, your budget, and what type of services the web host offers. 
Hosting options available are:

Free Hosting
Shared Hosting
Dedicated Hosting
Collocated Hosting

Free Hosting
Free web hosting can be a good choice when you just want to build a non-critical website for fun. Very often in a free hosting environment, connection speed is slow, website can be down frequently, and advertising banners are automatically added to your website. Some companies require you to purchase your domain name to receive free hosting services from them, while others offer you a free subdomain under them, such as [yourname.webhost.com]. Be careful as you will not be able to transfer these free subdomains.
Shared Hosting
In a shared hosting environment, your and other website owners shared one server. This includes sharing the physical server and the software applications within the server. Shared hosting services are affordable because the cost to operate the server is shared between you and these other owners. There are, however, a number of down sides, such as being slower.
Dedicated Hosting
In a dedicated hosting environment, you have the entire web server to yourself. This allows for faster performance, as you have all the server’s resources entirely, without sharing with other website owners. However, this also means that you will be responsible for the cost of server operation entirely. This is a good choice for websites that require a lot of system resources, or need a higher level of security.

Collocated Hosting
In this type of hosting, you will purchase your own server and have it housed at a web host’s facilities. You will be responsible for the server itself. An advantage of this type of hosting service is you have full control of the web server. You can install any scripts or applications you need. [/details]

It’s going to be a headache to debug. There is a lot going on in your main function. Too much. You need to break the game up into many more smaller functions.
The code is also very hard to read and debug because the style is inconsistent.

Does it sound right to you that a turn can be both black and white?, and in C/C++ = is for assignment, and == is for comparison.

Totally off topic, but related…
Never write a do in such as way as it takes scolling to find the while. Use functional coding to abstact things away from the loop body. Keep do and while easily visible, together.

Parsing Large Numbers Question
Hi All, I am writing some simple code to raise a base value to a power
then perform some operations on the output. I have included the code I am
using now, below ( see end of this message ), also see immediately below
what this looks like when I run my script from the console ;
…
C:\PYTHON34>python tst.py
INPUT Value: 431.1
INPUT Power Value; 1.9907
RESULT 1739.554505641426658257842063903808593750000000000000000000000000
…
What I need to be able to do ;
1.) Store whole number value to left of the decimal point without decimals to
a variable = x
2.) Grab entire decimal value to the right of the decimal point and store in a variable
= y
Parse (y) according to some simple rules. Here’s where it gets trick for me.
What I want to do is examine (y) to see if there are any leading leading and trailing zeros
In the example ; “1739.554505…” IF this value was instead, something like any of the following ;
1739.0554505
1739.00554505
1739.000554505
Then I want to extract the whole number less any continuous leading zeroes
NEXT, I want to cut the number so that when there are four continuous trailing zeros, all zeros
starting from the first one that started off the first four continuous zeros and all following zeroes are
truncated
So in our example ;
“1739.554505641426658257842063903808593750000000000000000000000000”
(y) becomes “55450564142665825784206390380859375”
Next I want to take the mod of above value by %1999
This returns “1407”
Next I want to join this value AS the decimal value to the right as ;
1739.1407
Ok, so now why am I stuck at this point?
I’m still fairly new to learning Python so I don’t actually kknow what the best ways are to do this.
I’m thinking I could maybe just do a trim on the value to the right of the decimal, take that, convert the whole thing to a string, then chop up each digit and store each individually to an array then code a rule set for stepping through strings in array cells, but this also seems like it could take more CPU time than I’d like. I’m hoping to perform this sort of operation fast, as fast as possible.
Also, I do not even know how to best approach this even if I had to store this as a string into an array, and if I munderstand correctly string processing tends to takes more CPU time than number calcs.
Any insight, direction, code suggestions greatly appreciated!
This is the code I am currently using ;
import time
e0=time.time()
c0=time.clock()

import sys
import math
from sympy import mpmath
from mpmath import *
mpmath.mp.dps = 10000

inputx = float(input('Enter inputx Value: '))
powerx =float(input('Enter Power Value; '))

inputx_squared = float((mpmath.power(inputx, powerx)))%1999

print('\r')
print('RESULT ', '%.60f' % inputx_squared)

elapsed_time=time.time() -e0
cpu_time=time.clock() -c0

337,How do i get good at problem solving?,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
My biggest issue with programming is solving problems, i love programming so i would love to pursue it was my dream job but im not really good with problem solving
","
Can you give us an example of a problem for context?

This is a problem in a course im doing that I dont even know where to begin with

Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
The method needs to return a boolean.
It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
Check the tips below for more info about palindromes.
Example Input/Output
isPalindrome(-1221); → should return true
isPalindrome(707); → should return true
isPalindrome(11212); → should return false because reverse is 21211 and that is not equal to 11212.
Tip: What is a Palindrome number?  A palindrome number is a number which when reversed is equal to the original number. For example: 121, 12321, 1001 etc.
Tip: Logic to check a palindrome number
Find the the reverse of the given number. Store it in some variable say reverse. Compare the number with reverse.
If both are the the same then the number is a palindrome otherwise it is not.
Tip: Logic to reverse a number
Declare and initialize another variable to store the reverse of a number, for example reverse = 0.
Extract the last digit of the given number by performing the modulo division (remainder).
Store the last digit to some variable say lastDigit = num % 10.
Increase the place value of reverse by one.
To increase place value multiply the reverse variable by 10 e.g. reverse = reverse * 10.
Add lastDigit to reverse.
Since the last digit of the number is processed, remove the last digit of num. To remove the last digit divide number by 10.
Repeat steps until number is not equal to (or greater than) zero.
A while loop would be good for this coding exercise.
Tip: Be careful with negative numbers. They can also be palindrome numbers.
Tip: Be careful with reversing a number, you will need a parameter for comparing a reversed number with the starting number (parameter).
NOTE: The method isPalindrome needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing


First we must be sure that all the terminology is comprehended.
palindrome number  # described in one of the Tips

modulo division    # example given, num % 10

Is the suggested algorithm familiar to you?

These are likely the lines raising the error…

Just include the event parameter in both function()s.
Should the mouseup event trigger keyPlay()?

Likely because the authors are all working on Macs using Chrome or Safari, or in Linux using Chrome. I rather doubt they do much testing with FF back there. I use FF almost exclusively and my version of this worked at the time I completed the assignment.
Give it another go, and if we still haven’t nailed this down, I’ll compare your code to mine.

sorry but this dosen’t work either,
I’ve tried switching up the parameters and I couldn’t get it to work

Can you please post a link to the exercise page? Thanks.

This works in FF…
let colorChange = function(event) {
  let randomColor = `rgb(${rgb(256)}, ${rgb(256)}, ${rgb(256)})`;
  event.target.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
}


the piano project:

the event exercise:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/build-interactive-websites/modules/dom-javascript-events/lessons/dom-events/exercises/dom-event-types

I wrote callback references on the listeners…
function keyPlay(event) {
  event.target.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
}
function keyReturn(event) {
  event.target.style.backgroundColor = '';
}
function assignKey(note) {
  note.onmousedown = keyPlay;
  note.onmouseup = keyReturn;
}

Notice also that keyPlay is on mousedown, and keyReturn is on mouseup.

Thanks alot !
I dont understand why this works and not the previous attempts but still thanks !

I was searching for this information…Thanks for posting this.

A function does something. F(x) = x^2 is a function that squares what it is given.
A list holds things. [1,2,3,4,5] is a list of the numbers 1-5.
I can execute a function on each element of a list.

is it possible that some condition function is a part of list and list is part of function?
example : list = [x^3,x^4,x^5,…) or list = [f1,f2,f3,f4] ?
function ; f(x) = list 1 ^ 2x?

How you create games is a journey on its own and there are lots of tutorials out there for beginners.
To get your code running outside codecadamy:
Javascript
For Javascript it is actually very easy since it runs in your browser. Here is a template code i useally use when testing Javascript code on this forum.
<html>
<head>
<!-- Any css you might wanna use. -->
<style>
</style>

<!-- Uncomment jquery if you want youre project to use jquery -->
<!-- <script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js""></script> -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- <div id=""example""></div> -->

<script>
//----------------
// Javascript
//----------------

// define youre variables here
// let example = value;

(function() {
	// runs after the html document is loaded. Any code that refers html elements go's here.
	// let exampleElement = document.getElemenentById('example');
	
})();

</script>
</body>
</html>

Simply save this as a .html file and you will be able to run it in your browser.
For a code editor i use notepad++ which is a very basic editor.
I think this is the most basic way to start coding in Javascript.
Python
Python is not that easy but there is a lot of programs that help make it easier. I myself use anaconda for python which can create environments that makes sure you don’t have your python and other packages installed all over the place.
A good package to use with python to create python games is pygame.

354,See Solution After You've Solved An Exercise,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Hi all,
I’m currently working through the Python3 course and I was wondering if there’s any way you can see the solution after solving an exercise.
Often i like to try solving a problem before looking at the solution, and even if my output happens to be correct i would still like to know how a “pro” would do it so i could compare it to my code. But currently i can’t seem to view the official solution after i solved the exercise. Is there any way to do this?
If not i think this would be a great feature to implement a “See official solution” button after you’ve solved an exercise. Even though I’m fairly new to coding I’ve got the impression that It’s not all about the output your code gives, but also being able to get that output with the “simplest” code possible. I also want to be able to write code as proffesionally as possible. I believe a feature like this would help to improve that.
Anyone else feel the same way?
","
Yes, it is good idea, even if you pass the exercise that doesn’t mean that your code is good, for example(this example isn’t good because it would fail the test):
Log “Hello world” 3 times to the console using loops
//needed code
for (let i=0;i<3;i++) {
  console.log(""Hello world"");
}
//the bad code(I mean for the exercise)
console.log(""Hello world"");
console.log(""Hello world"");
console.log(""Hello world"");

355,Web Development Path vs Learn CSS course,"Get Help,General Programming",,4,"
Hello everyone!
I have started using codeacademy a couple of days ago and since i am a beginner with very little coding background in HTML and CSS, i decided to choose the Web Development Path. My intention is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL.
After completing the first two sections of the Web Development Path (Learn HTML, Styling a Website), i faced a dilemma. The 3rd section of the specific path takes me to “Getting started with JavaScript”, which sure sounds exiting. But i noticed that in the Learn CSS course, the second part is “The Box Model”, section that is the 5th part in the WDP.
My dilemma is, should i take the WDP path and learn a bit about JavaScript before i get to the more advanced “Box model” section of CSS, or continue all the way down to the CSS course and deal with JavaScript later. What would you guys consider the optimal learning approach?
Thank you for your answers.
","
IF you’re going to build function, using JavaScript and SQL, it’s also worth learning PHP.
Since HTML and CSS are primarily markup, I’d stick with those, get as in depth (and as comfortable) with them as you can, before moving into functional programming with JavaScript, PHP, and ultimately the use of SQL.

And i was wondering how php fits to all of this 
Thank you for your answer. Also for me the logical approach is to complete the CSS course. But the Web Development Path made me thinking if learning the fundamentals of JavaScript early, had something vital to offer to the HMTL-CSS combo.

Are instructions specific orders of steps to do something. Like a recipe to bake a cake which is an example of where instructions may be used. Am I right yes or no? If I am not right please tell me why?

The computer does not know anything about the programs we give it to run. Our human readable code is interpreted and converted to byte code then compiled into the language the machine can run… Machine language, aka. binary executable.
If the instruction can be interpretted then it can be compiled. Errors found during interpretation are caught as Syntax Errors. Those that are not detected until a fault is encountered during execution are called Run Time Errors, or Exceptions.
A program may be loosely compared to a recipe, though the human writing the program is more likely the one following said descriptive instructions (known as ideation and implementation). The programmer has an objective, formulates a plan of attack, writes the instructions in the order in which they MUST be carried out, supplies needed data and data structures to maintain data integrity, then hands it to the computer to interpret and compile. If all goes well up to that point, the code will execute as planned and expected with the desired outcome. If not, well, back to the drawing board.
Let’s examine a very basic sequence of inline code using ES6
let a = 6;
let b = 7;
let c = a + b;
console.log(c);    // 13

The number literals as known as values. They are hardcoded into the program and likely reside exactly where they are written in the namespace. The interpreter, with the help of a number of system operations is able to draw a connection between the variable (a label) and the data it is associated with.
The third line tells the interpreter to fetch the values for a and b and to perform an addition operation on them, which results in a new value that the system stores in memory and binds the location to the variable, c. Now we can retrieve that value and log it to the terminal.
It looks simple and easy to us humans, but the computer is doing a tonne of work that we don’t see. It is not so simple at the machine level and there are a lot of moving parts. Thankfully in this day and age we don’t have to learn about those aspects like we would have had to in the early days of computers.
Bottom line, computers are dumb. We humans are the ones expected to think everything through, write concise code to follow our instructions, and then test and debug as needed until we have a finished model. Computers don’t make mistakes, people (programmers) do. Well written interpreters can spot syntactical errors, and well written compilers can usually identify where something has gone wrong, and maybe why, but they depend heavily on the person behind the program design and implementation to verify and validate everything they write into their code. The recipe analogy can only be taken so far by way of comparison.

358,Concatenate arrays into matrix and reshape as required,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
Dear all,
I am trying to obtain a matrix in this form:

[

[‘a2’, ‘b2’, ‘c2’],
[‘a3’, ‘b3’, ‘c3’],

from the arrays:

A = np.array([‘a1’, ‘a2’, ‘a3’, ‘a4’])
B = np.array([‘b1’, ‘b2’, ‘b3’, ‘b4’])
C = np.array([‘c1’, ‘c2’, ‘c3’, ‘c4’])

agree with above - cannot get further than the first stage

I am having the same issues as the above members. The code editor does not update along with the lesson as you progress in the instructions. I tried to edit the command to get the prompt to follow the instructions when it came to changing color, but I messed it up and couldn’t remember the prompts from the previous instructions so it’s now totally clear and will not reset.
This is our first intro to coding, and specifically, my son wants to learn to code and I would love for him to get this, but hitting this snag already is discouraging. Any advice or help with this would help. Thank you in advance.

Same for me, what should we do to get further?

I’m having issues with this too. I am just starting over from the intro course and when I get into the second page or part it automatically runs the code that’s already there and it says it’s wrong before I’ve typed my name. When I do type my name, it says there was an error and shows the red x in the checklist. Is there a reason for this? Am I missing something? I’d love to know, thanks! I tried the bash course and that’s working properly. So confused.

Refresh the page & strictly follow the instructions given in the left half of the screen. If refreshing doesn’t help, go to the home page & come back to the start coding page. Hope it helps.

360,What language should I learn if I want to be a software engineer when I'm older?,"Get Help,General Programming",,5,"
Hi, the CodeCademy community,
Just a quick question I’m currently in grade 10 and am wondering what language I should learn if I want to be a software engineer. I have just started the python 3 courses but am not sure if it is the best option. Should I instead choose javascript or another language?
Thanks, Opious
","
I guess anyone who knows multiple languages has a higher chance of getting a job.
I came here to get some skills in web development and I must say I like the slowly easing into programming via first HTML, then CSS and currently JavaScript and SASS. I might even move into Python next since I got a yearly subscription to Pro from my boss.
HTML and CSS is not really programming but they already make you get familiar with using syntax. JavaScript prepares me into thinking in variables, functions, conditionals etc. Something I did’nt really like before… Perhaps you could start there?
Greetings,
Jannes

according to my opinion i would like to suggest you .you can learn python because python are more used in machine learning and artificial intelligence . ML and AI are more used in  in future.if you are interested than you can learn python best [python training classes in Delhi](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-python-course-in-delhi/
/).

Just learn programming in general. Stick with what you like but try other things.
It’s impossible to know what will be THE  language or IF there will be.
People make money with COBOL to this day. In 30 years there will be mainstream quantum computing yet people will still be paid to code c and python on silicon id imagine.

Python is one of the most popular though it depends what software job you want.

One way that I leant some MySql is though Microsofts Access and excel. For this you would need the Office home bundle. What I did it that I found Projects online that looked fun and tried to recreate them in a similar but different way. When I got more confident I decided on making a few Databases for myself like one that stores my password for sites ect. For Testing in site environment I would Use Xampp and Php my admin .

I saw that databases like Access and Open Office Base let you edit the data with SQL commands. I’ll just do that if I can’t figure it out. I wanted a more realistic situation though and learn how to access an SQL database.
MySQL is free to download. I was kind of surprised when I found that out. I still have difficulty accessing it. There is also a MySQL server manager that is an IDE. I think these things are meant to be accessed remotely. I’ll see what I can do when my new laptop is delivered, and I’ll read the manuals for some of the different databases.




 aorchowski:

MySQL is free to download


yes, now you just need a client (for example mysql workbench), there you can execute queries.

I figured that was the case. Hopefully it’ll be easier to set up when my new computer arrives so I can have a server and client.

you can configure the client and server on the same machine, that isn’t a problem. Mysql is just a program which support multiple ways to be accessed. These include local as well as remote.
computers come with a nifty tricky (something called a loopback network interface, better now as localhost or 127.0.0.1) to run servers (mysql, nginx, apache and many more) on your local machine.

thanks for the help. I’ll look into that

Any WWW forum will be using a licensed platform.scaled to their user base. At a very minimum, we want a platform that can handle thousands of connections at any one time. After that it goes up by degrees. As we move up the scale the price of the license grows accordingly. The level of support may also increase with volume demand. Ultimately, this is not cheap.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.
So, taking this further, if you compare cost of this to a hard coded forum, how lot would be the overhead of maintaining and cost split? Could you give me insights on it?




 websurfer29642:

Could you give me insights on it?


That would be impossible. I’ve never built a forum before, only know that the going concerns are very expensive to keep afloat, secure and updated. There are a lot of moving parts and inveritably a team of engineers on staff to handle the heavy lifting.
That’s not to say there isn’t a way to create a small scale forum, I just don’t have any advice on how to go about it. One would at the very least require a domain, a host that offers nearly unlimited traffic, a secure site (https), a secure and well managed database, interactive forum software on the backend and the frontend, &c.

Answer
Programming gives us the ability to write algorithms to solve specific problems and perform complex calculations with large amounts of data. By utilizing the power of computer processing, these programs can run almost instantaneously even on huge datasets.
Furthermore, programming is necessary to complete many tasks including cleaning our data, evaluating the results of experiments, and graphing the data in ways that are presentable.

You first need to understand what localhost is:

Thank you for the response. I will look into it. So it shouldn’t make a difference what software I’m using to write the code in? e.g. Visual Studio
When I’m watching tutorials it sometimes looks like the local host is a part of the software and the person in the tutorial will be able to run the code from the software to the server.

 dwcullen:

software is very broad term. But yes, when creating back-ends of websites, running the server locally (using localhost loopback) is very common practice. But there are so many programs can do this. Npm, docker, virtual machines, some frameworks (django for example) come with there own local development server (simple webserver written in python)
it wouldn’t surprise me if certain text-editors do offer support to manipulate the web server through the text-editor.

Either works. Google usually has more answers though sometimes Computer Science dictionary is better because Google can be unreliable. It just depends.

What should I do if the meaning of a programming term is not in an English dictionary on google? An example of a programming term is Return and there is no meaning of that programming term in an English dictionary on google.

There are two parts to this: return is most certainly in the english dictionary, understanding what it means (return = handing something back), then you need to understand how its used within programming, for which you can consult the documentation of the programming language you are using.
This means reading explanations, looking at examples and fiddling with these examples.

Is that the way to find the meaning of the programming term return? Can I do the same way to find the meaning of other programming terms?

what is wrong with googling, reading documentation/tutorials and fiddling with examples? You could watch youtube videos as well

Does execute mean to carry out an instruction in a computer program? Am I right yes or no?

This  is  the Central Processing Unit, or CPU. … The job of the CPU  is  to  execute programs . A  program is  simply a list of unambiguous  instructions meant  to be followed mechanically by a  computer . A  computer is  built to  carry out instructions that are written in a very simple type of language called machine language.

How can a computer actually run?

Ever had or seen a dog that loved nothing more than to chase a ball? Everytime it was thrown they would retrieve it, bring it back and drop it, readying to chase it down once again.
That is a computer. Always ready to chase the ball. Electronically it’s a bit complicated to explain, but think of a key ring. There is always a next key on the right. It’s this kind of loop that a computer is caught in. It only stays alive if it can keep up this loop, indefinitely.
A motherboard is typically equipped with a ROM that is the starting program when the power is turned on. Voltage trickles through the circuitry and tickles a starting address in the ROM that starts the ball rolling. Instructions in machine code always know where the next instruction lives before they execute. That way when they’re done, the computer knows where to go for the next instruction. In the key ring example, each key knows where the next one is.
We’ll be chasing down a rabbit hole if I continue, but you get the gist…

373,"Should kids learn real coding, or stick to 3rd party programs like Code Monkey or Scratch?","Get Help,General Programming",,79,"
I’m a little confused. Should kids start out with Scratch or Code Monkey, or go straight to learning real coding. Which should I choose, and why? Would kids become discouraged?
","
Depends on the age i would say.
When i whas around 13 i whas amazed when i saw some upperclass schooler code mario. This got my interest and is why i started coding. But i dont know if i would have gotten into it if i never saw any visual result.
It is hard to code and even harder when it takes long to see results.
So if the kids choose for it it might be good to give them a taste of real coding (it should be basic and with results tho).
If the kids dont choose for it. it might be better to use a 3rd party. This way you can be sure they atleast get the basics to become interested.
This is my opinion tho.

Well @biirra, pretty much after that they need to do ACTUAL coding. They can’t just keep doing 3rd party.

So what would be basic if starting with real coding? I personally think Python might be good.

Do you mean that coding is mandatory on schools now ?
Also if you understand the coding structure (if/else statements and stuff) that is still very obviously visible in 3rd party programs you wont be that surprised when you start actual coding.  It looks very similar.
for example (created with scratch):

is almost identical to (Javascript):
if( 1 === 1){
	playSound(""Meow"");
}else{
	stopAllSounds();
}


Coding is not mandatory yet. Most schools are starting to have coding classes now. I know, Scratch is basically JS, but slightly easier.

I don’t know which language is best for beginners.
To be honest i don’t think there is a “best” language for beginners. Since i am not a teacher and far from a professional myself i don’t feel comfortable answering this.
You could maybe ask/discuss this with other teachers from schools.

Ok. Well, I’m not talking exactly for school. Maybe at home. Thanks for your thoughts though 

Ah i understand, You could always try both you know. Make the kids decide what they find more fun to do.
As long as its fun its very motivating.

Welp, I was fascinated by Code Monkey and Scratch too, after I started actual coding. But I decided to stick with both.
I even play these games today, just to express my knowledge in an easier way. 

Thanks =)  This helps

Wouldn’t they always choose Code Monkey or Scratch because it’s easier, and more designed towards them? Would they even go to real coding at that point? I’m sorry, but I just don’t entirely understand.

Thats why i said it depends on the age. If they are like 12 years and younger i would advice a 3rd party program. Cause learning to write code requires a lot of reading/writing and we all remember how we liked that as a child. After they grow up and want more they are going to need to learn how to code since 3rd party programs are very limited.
If they where older than 12 i would not be suprised if they choose real coding. Since the third party tools look a bit childish. They are more training wheels after all.
But even if they do choose for 3rd party programs it should not be a problem. Amazing things have been created with 3rd party programs and it still counts as cooding (al tho its building code instead of writing code).

Thanks! That really helped =)

Don’t you have to be 13 to use Code Cademy? If so, some kids couldn’t use Code Cademy then.

I think you have to be 13 to create an account. I am not sure about this but i think kids can use an account that is on they’re parents name.
Also i don’t think it matters that much. Kids probably can’t join intensive courses. But otherwise its not like there’s someone checking everyone’s birthday everyday.
You have to check the rules for this one tho. Don’t be afraid to ask a moderator as well.

Ok. Thanks again! That helped. I read the rules and yes you are correct.

374,"In finding P(A|B), we use P(B|A) and vice versa. How do we find either without knowing one already?","Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
Bayes’ theorem provides a way of computing P(A|B) but uses P(B|A). How would we go about finding either without one being given initially?
Answer
To think about this question more clearly, we need to think about the intersection: P(A ∩ B). Recall that P(A ∩ B) is the probability that both A and B are true. We learned about P(A ∩ B) when A and B were independent but it also makes sense to think about the intersection in other cases.
First, let’s rephrase the conditional probability in plain language. P(A|B) is asking:

What is the probability that A will happen if we already know that B happened?

Written like this makes it clear that we’re asking a question about both A and B happening. So P(A|B) is related to P(A ∩ B) in some way but how exactly? There certainly not equal. This is where our knowledge that B already happened comes into play. Since B happened, the probability that we’re computing is essentially no longer between 0 and 1 but instead between 0 and P(B). Tying this all together, we can rewrite P(A|B) as follows
P(A|B) = P(A  ∩ B) / P(B)
This presents us with another way of computing conditional probabilities: we can compute the probability of the intersection.

375,What are other techniques for testing for regression in an application?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this lesson, we learn about testing for regression in an application. The technique presented seems to be to run the test suite each time we make an addition. Is there are less time consuming approach to regression testing?
Answer
If your application is “small”, you won’t have to worry about running the full test suite taking too much time. If, however, you are experiencing long waits while your test suite runs – and these issues don’t stem from an incorrect implementation – there are at least two alternatives available to you.

First, there is regression test selection. Unlike running the entire test suite, with this technique we set, and conditionally, execute different groups of test cases rather than automatically executing each group.
Second, there is test case prioritization. Here, we prioritize test cases so as to increase the test suite’s rate of fault detection. Test case prioritization techniques schedule test cases so that the test cases that are higher in priority are executed before the test cases that have a lower priority.

376,How to logarithmically write pseudocode?,"Get Help,General Programming",,9,"
“Computer Science 101: Master the Theory Behind Programming” is a course on Skill Share that mentioned how logarithms were the fastest way to complete operations.
I want my code to be fast, so how would I write it in a logarithm?
Apparently, a nested for loop (eg.) is one of the slower ways to get a computer to do operations - because n^2, where n is the number of operations, if both loops are the same length.
","
You’re misreading that.
Different tasks take different amounts of work.
Your text does not say that all tasks can be done in the same amount work.

I didn’t say that all tasks would be the same amount of work… ?




 speed_reader_steve:

that mentioned how logarithms were the fastest way to complete operations


You’re saying all operations
(also, 0 is less than log n, which is the amount of work for something you don’t do at all, that is fastest)
There do exist tasks which can at best be carried out in log n amount of time. But these are not all tasks, some can be done faster, some can’t be done in that amount of time.

Keep in mind this isn’t some special programming construct (you’re asking how to write it in pseudo code)
It’s just the amount of work/number of steps that are required to complete a task.
For example, how much work is it to greet everyone in a room?
You could greet everyone one at a time, or you get them all to shush and greet them all at once - these are different amounts of work for the same task.

Fair enough.  Could you give examples where logarithms can apply?

Interesting how the two words are anagrams of each other. (algorithm and logarithm)




 speed_reader_steve:

Could you give examples where logarithms can apply?


How many times does 128 need to be halved to reach 1?

log2 128 = 7
27 = 128

It’s the inverse of exponentiation, same as how division is the inverse to multiplication and subtraction to addition

And the only reason it’s related to computer science is that we do stuff with computers and when we want to describe and/or reason about stuff we use math.
So it’s the same as addition/subtraction/multiplication … and so on, there’s nothing special going on
What your text is probably doing is talking about some specific task for which the amount of work required can be described with an expression using logarithms
So again with the room of people to greet.
If there are N people in the room, then it takes
N
Amount of work to greet them one at a time.
If instead greeting them all at once then it takes
1
Amount of work.
To walk around a square with a side of size N, you need to walk 4N amount of distance. To fill a square you need to fill N*N amount of space

If you do operations with trees then you’re likely wondering what the distance from the root to a leaf is. If that tree is balanced, then that depth is log N
If you divide an array repeatedly into two parts as part of sorting (quicksort/mergesort), then log N is going to be the depth of that recursion. At each depth level there will be a total amount of N work, so log N depths N times means that these sorting algorithms complete in N * log N amount of work

377,What are some reasons that you might return to a previous step in the data science process?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, which covers the data science process, what are some reasons you might return to a previous step as you are working through the process?
Answer
While working through the data science process, it is common that scientists might have to return to a previous step or repeat some steps many times. It is also possible that the entire process must be repeated or redone from the beginning.
There can be many reasons for this.
Usually, when working through the process, there can be errors or some new insights at a certain step which requires going back to a previous step. For instance, when determining the necessary data, the team might realize that the initial question is not feasible anymore when looking at the required data. Because of this, they have to go back and reword or change the question.
Or, as they are cleaning and organizing the data, they realize that the data is too sparse, and cannot give good insights. This would require them to go back and redo the data collection step.
In addition, when working for a company, steps in the process might need to be repeated because of things like costs, time, the company vision, and other reasons that may or may not be in control of the scientists.

381,"Why is the ""naive"", independence, assumption necessary for the naive Bayes classifier?","Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the naive Bayes lesson, when computing P(review|positive) for review = ""This crib was amazing"", the exercise states that

In other words, if we assume that the review is positive, what is the probability that the words “This”, “crib”, “was”, and “amazing” are the only words in the review? To find this, we have to assume that each word is conditionally independent.

Why must we make this assumption?
Answer
To understand why we choose the naive assumption (why we assume that each word is conditionally independent) let’s take a closer look at the probability P(review | positive). Computing this probability is not very simple. Because we’re considering each word in the review, P(review|positive) for review = ""This crib was amazing"" will expand to equal

P(""this"" | ""crib"", ""is"", ""amazing"", positive) * P(""crib"" | ""is"", ""amazing"", positive) * ... * P(""amazing"" | positive)

This can get quite messy. Assuming that we have conditional independence makes the above computation equivalent to

P(""this""| positive)*P(""crib""|positive)*P(""is""|positive)*P(""amazing""|positive)

This is because, as we can recall, if A and B are independent then P(A|B) = P(A) and vice versa.
So to conclude, we make this “naive” assumption because it makes our computations much easier to compute and reason about.

Hello
I have no clue why my background image isn’t working, I need to finish this website in two days for a school project and this is not a good start! Please help!

Ok first if this is all your code then you are doing it wrong, this is how you make the structure:
(!doctype html is not needed btw)
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>


Also, this code needs to be in the head with <style> here’s how:

<html>
<head>
<style>
{box-sizing: border-box;} .body {background-image: url (hello.jpg); 
</style>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>


(I don’t know why the code is red)
also im not very good at CSS but I have a feeling somethings wrong with the code,
shouldn’t be like:
body {
     ???
}

sorry im not an expert 

So lets assume that we want to set up a simple webpage with a background
You would normally start with a 
DOCTYPE is good practice (though it isn’t required) as the tag tells the browser that we are using html5 and not older html versions.
Next, we want to set up the general webpage structure.
Now with that done, you should use css to make your background appear. Note: This is done within the style tag
body {
background-image: url(hello.jpg);
}
Now notice how I didn’t put the period? That is because the period would indicate that we are styling a class, in this case we are not. We are, however, styling the body tag.
This is mainly all that is wrong with your css code compared to mine.  Happy Coding!

You are right! DOCTYPE isn’t required, however, the doctype tag (which has to be capitalized) declares the version of html we are using.

You are definitely right about that.

The first one isn’t empty and the latter doesn’t make any sense, an undefined constant is not useful.

Thanks @ionatan
so, how to declare a empty variable in JS?

What do you mean by empty and what do you need it for?
Variables aren’t storage, they can’t be empty just like how they can’t be full - they’re not space. They can refer to something, or not.
You’d declare it without assigning a value. What you won’t want to do however is to have an undefined constant since that will forever remain undefined… due to being constant… that’s useless.






Above the empty object, declare an empty variable that will hold the user’s access token.

I’m trying to do this in ‘Jammming’ project…

Riight but you’ve been using mutable variables in loops and such haven’t you? Use that instead of const

Ok, thank you @ionatan

You could also take your code somewhere that has a debugger and debug it to see WHERE the indent error happens.

386,Functions in programming,"Get Help,General Programming",,6,"
Are functions in mathematics similar to functions in programming. Am I right yes or no?
","
Exactly the same.
In mathematics I give a function an input and the function does it’s “thing” and hands me back an output.
Functions are similar in programming
Think of a function that squares a number
int square(int n) {
    return n*n
}

You give the function it’s input “n”
from there the function mutates n by multiplying it by itself
it returns this new output to you.




 fight_dragons:

Exactly the same.


Not so. Similar in an anologous way, but not exact.
Functions in programming are re-usable code blocks that can take any form. In maths they refer to variation of y in terms of x.
y = f(x)

y varies as x according to the relationship defined in the equation.
f(x) = ax + b

where a and b are fixed, and x is the independent variable. When f(x) returns more than one value for y for one input of x, it is no longer a function, but a relation.
Take for instance a standard quadratic,
f(x) = ax^2

which produces a parabola centered about the original and reflected off the y axis. Each value of x yields only one value for y. If we rotate the graph 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise it is no longer a function since we get two values for y for one value of x.
x = ay^2

which when we solve for y, becomes,
y = +/-(x / a) ^ 0.5

As we can see, there are now two solutions.
We can write program functions that emulate maths, but that is where the similarity ends.

Is the definition of return to give something back as an answer? Am I right yes or no?




 allankiza5260337834:

return to give something back as an answer?


More or less, yes. A return is the response of the function to the caller. The caller is in a scope different from the function, and return bridges the scope gap.

I’m having trouble with coding a fighting platformer in Javascript and I’ve got mostly everything down. Collision detection, gravity, movement, but not attacking (still working on that). I’ve seem to run into a problem where if the player is on the main stage the player will not jump. I’ve checked Google and Youtube and I haven’t found a solution to my problem.
(I checked out this video by PothOnProgramming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uIt9a2XBrw)
Here’s my code: (also I’m fine with some feedback on code changes)

Hello @krcodersome,
After analysis your code, I did some minor changes for you:
world.js
const Player1 = new Player(1000, 300, 1);
const Player2 = new Player(1300, 300, 2);

//<editor-fold> Controls pt.1
let keys = [];
window.addEventListener(""keydown"", function(evt) {
  keys[evt.keyCode] = true;
});

window.addEventListener(""keyup"", function(evt) {
  keys[evt.keyCode] = false;
});

window.addEventListener(""mousedown"", function() {
  Player1.color = ""red"";
  Player1.attack(Player2);
});

window.addEventListener(""mouseup"", function() {
  Player1.color = ""black"";
});
//</editor-fold>

function tick() {
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  Stage.draw();
  Player1.update();
  Player2.update();

//<editor-fold> Controls pt.2
  if(keys[65]) { // Left
    Player1.moveLeft();
  }

  if(keys[87]) {
    Player1.jumping = true;
    Player1.jump();
  }

  if(keys[68]) { // Right
    Player1.moveRight();
  }
//</editor-fold>
}
tick();

players.js
function Player(x, y, id) {
  this.x = x; this.startingX = x; this.dx = 0; this.xAttackDirection = 0; this.width = 25;
  this.y = y; this.startingY = y; this.dy = 0; this.yAttackDirection = 0; this.height = 25;
  this.maxSpeed = 5;
  this.friction = 0.95;
  this.timesJumped = 0;
  this.jumping = false;
  this.id = id;
  this.color = ""black"";

//<editor-fold> Player appearance
  this.draw = function() {
    ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
    ctx.fillRect(Math.round(this.x), this.y, this.width, this.height);
  },
//</editor-fold>

//<editor-fold Animating
  this.update = function() {
    this.draw();

    if(((Stage.y - this.height <= this.y && this.y <= Stage.y) && (Stage.x + this.width <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x + (Stage.width - this.width*2))) || ((Stage.x - this.width <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x + this.width) && this.y == Stage.y - this.height) || ((Stage.x + (Stage.width - this.width*2) <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x + Stage.width) && this.y == Stage.y - this.height)) {
      this.y = Stage.y - this.height;
      if (!this.jumping) {
        this.dy = 0;
      }
    }

    if((Stage.y + this.height <= this.y && this.y <= Stage.y + Stage.height) && (Stage.x - this.width <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x) || ((Stage.x - this.width <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x) && (Stage.y - (this.height-1) <= this.y && this.y <= Stage.y + Stage.height))) { // Left border
      if(this.dx > 0) {
        this.dx = 0;
        this.x = Stage.x - this.width;
      }
    }

    if((Stage.y + this.height <= this.y && this.y <= Stage.y + Stage.height) && (Stage.x + (Stage.width - this.width) <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x + Stage.width) || ((Stage.x + Stage.width - this.width <= this.x && this.x <= Stage.x + Stage.width) && (Stage.y - (this.height-1) <= this.y && this.y <= Stage.y + Stage.height))) { // Right border
      if(this.dx < 0) {
        this.dx = 0;
        this.x = Stage.x + Stage.width;
      }
    }

    if (this.y >= canvas.height + this.height || this.y < 0 - this.height) {
      this.x = this.startingX;
      this.y = this.startingY;
    }
    console.log(this.dy);

    if(this.dy < 1) {
      this.dy++;
    }

    this.dx *= this.friction;
    this.x += this.dx;
    this.y += this.dy;
  },

  this.moveLeft = function() {
    if(this.dx > -this.maxSpeed) {
      this.dx--;
    }

    this.xAttackDirection = -25;
  },

  this.moveRight = function() {
    if(this.dx < this.maxSpeed) {
      this.dx++;
    }

    this.xAttackDirection = 25;
  }
//</editor-fold>

//<editor-fold> Extra Functions
  this.jump = function() {
    this.dy -= 3;
  },

  this.touching = function(player) {
    return !(this.x + this.width < player.x ||
    this.x > player.x + player.width ||
    this.y + this.height < player.y ||
    this.y > player.y + player.height);
  },

  this.attack = function(player) {
    if(this.touching(player)) {
      player.dx += this.xAttackDirection;
      player.dy -= 50;
    }
  }
//</editor-fold>
}

Notice the little fix I did, I removed the extra stuff at the keyup and keydown events for the world.js and also called the jump method. For the Players.js, just added a condition for the dy value and lowered it a bit to have a smooth jump 

@kingdarboja Thank you so much!

Hi, i followed along on this pretty well and get everything done but I kept running into a problem where the IDE kept outputting […] as lists and my code is EXACTLY what the video has. Am I going insane or missing something simple because this is driving me crazy, I’m normally good at strings!!! EDIT I never messed with anything above where it says to start coding.

Check if your lists contain themselves, for example:
a = []
a.append(a)
print(a)
print(a[0] is a)


I started from scratch just following the directions and though i understand them better, I am getting a syntax error that makes no sense to me. Here is the URL and underneath is a screen-shot with the complete code and error. 
EDIT I think last time i just went too fast through it and didn’t read the instructions well enough…Lesson learned.
URL: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/projects/thread-shed

So you’ve put quotes around the dot in line 112?

I was trying different things and deleted them but yes i did, just did it again for the screenshot

So then the real error surfaces.

That’s an extremely helpful error message, read what it has to say and then think about whether that sounds right, and consider what you think needs to be different in that situation to match what you meant
(by helpful I mean that it says exactly what the problem is, a non-programmer might think that “helpful” means a suggestion on how to correct it but that is absolutely not something that a computer can know what you meant so a suggestion would be incredibly unhelpful. coming up with what to do next comes from understanding the situation and comparing it to what you meant, the difference (subtraction, essentially) is the change that you need to make)
I know languages that will just tell you:
?
If you do something wrong like this.

This is going directly over my head, it’s quite frustrating. Are you saying i need to add another line for context? he says with a fear of sounding dumb

No I mean that your line which is triggering that error message has some intention behind it (your intention)
Your error message explains why you can’t do what you wrote.
So first thing is to decide whether you agree with the error message that this is indeed not possible.
And then you’d compare your intention to this situation, what did you mean should be different?

It says a list has no split attribute.
Are you calling split on a list?
Does a list have a split attribute?

There is a feeling of haste and I don’t know why, but it tends to happen when i ask for help. Since it says to split around commas I keep getting lost. Like my brain throws a syntax error of it’s own.

You can’t possibly start guessing at what a solution would be before sorting out what the current situation is.
You’re attempting to use a method named split.
Does that value have such a method? (your error message tells you all about this, it doesn’t)
So either you thought this type does have such a method, or you thought it was a different type. <- this says a whole lot about what you need to change
Or if you just don’t know what you meant that your line of code should do, then you have to figure out that before anything else. Can’t write code without knowing what it is you want to make happen.

How about looking at the value, printing it out.
I’m starting to get the sense that what’s “wrong” about the whole situation is that you’ve lost touch with intention. (Like I said a few minutes ago, it makes no sense at all to write code without intention)
And if that’s indeed the case then you need to re-sync on what’s supposed to happen.
Codecademy doesn’t help with this because of how it says “do this, do that” while skipping out on telling you on what’s being done. Yet, by reading the instructions you can get yourself an idea of what’s supposed to happen, and then you can write code based on that

I see commas in the replaced sales so i just don’t get it… I guess I just have to go back to the string method because i guess I’m missing something.

Sure there are commas in some form or another.
But what data type is the whole value, and what operations does that value type support? And, what kind of operation are you looking for, and how does that relate to what you currently have in your value? Maybe it needs to be restructured in some way, or maybe it wasn’t supposed to be structured that way in the first place, or maybe that’s not at all the action you’re supposed to be doing.
“I have a number, and my intention is to add 5 to it. This makes sense because numbers support this operation, and the way that numbers expose this behaviour is through the + operator”

I need a for loop because i changed the data type from string to list…right?

No idea. No clue what you’re doing (no, don’t tell me)
This is where intention comes in. What did you mean.

I thought you were going to tell me i was right lol
I’m trying to split "" daily_transactions_replaced"" at the commas and put it into a new list.

Nope, I’ll do no such thing.
The decision of what to do is, I’m sure, entirely trivial. It’s not really related to programming. It’s more like going to the kitchen for some water to drink and having to figure out how to carry the water. You’ll need a container you can carry, a glass would be nice.
You just need to compare the right things, ie what you currently have, what you’re looking to change about it, what operations make sense to do with what you have, what operations you need to carry out.
Once you’ve got your intentions straightened out, and you’ve reasoned about that it makes sense, then comes the next step of translating to code. Yes, that’s entirely separate from deciding what to do, and the deciding part has to be done first for obvious reasons.

I believe you’re making sense but i’m currently trying to translate it into code. The way you explained it (thanks by the way) made me think about it this way “Why would i add(append) water to a glass ( empty list ) BEFORE I put it through the filter to take out the junk (delimiter)”
Hopefully that’s right and i can mark this solved.

395,What other responsibilities do data analysts have?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, what other responsibilities do data analysts have?
Answer
In addition to the responsibilities listed in the lesson, data analysts have several other responsibilities dealing with data. A few of these are as follows.
Data analysts also have the task of gathering and cleaning the data, such as by removing outliers or removing incorrect data. They also write more advanced queries utilizing multiple tables. Data analysts also calculate important values such as user retention in contrast to user churn rate. They also identify patterns and trends in the data. Furthermore, data analysts have the responsibility of communicating their work with others through presentations and by using visualizations.

396,Why is web traffic attribution important to determine?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why is web traffic attribution important to determine?
Answer
Web traffic attribution lets businesses or services find out what website a user was on before they came across their site. This is important for the businesses to know because it tells them what sites or ads attracted or brought users to their website. By knowing the sources of highest web traffic attribution, the businesses can then focus their efforts there, or use a similar strategy to increase traffic to their website.
",
397,Why is it helpful to know the churn rate?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why is it helpful to know the churn rate?
Answer
Churn rate is helpful mainly because it tells a business or service how many users or subscribers have canceled over a specific period of time. By knowing this, they can determine the reasons why users might have canceled, possibly due to some new feature or change in the service that may have caused people to leave. Companies want to stay profitable and to do so, they need to make sure that the rate of growth is greater than the churn rate. By determining the possible causes of customer churn, companies can react and make improvements to their service. In addition, another motivation is that reducing churn rate means increasing loyalty since more customers are continuing with the service for longer.

398,What can be stored in databases?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what can be stored in databases?
Answer
Databases can be used to store several types of data. The most common data types include text values, integers, float values, dates, and time.
The data types listed above work for most values, but sometimes databases may need to store values that require more memory than the types allow. In those cases, databases might store what are known as CLOB (Character large object), used for very long text values, or BLOB (binary large object values) types, which are used for multimedia objects like images or audio.

399,What are some tools that a data analyst uses?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, what are some tools that a data analyst uses?
Answer
Data analysts have a variety of tools that they use, which can depend on the task they must accomplish. A few of the tools which they utilize are as follows.
Probably one of the most important tools that a data analyst uses is a Database management system, such as MySQL, SQLite, or Oracle. Database management systems let data analysts write queries to perform things like create and manipulate databases, calculate aggregates, or combine multiple tables together. With this functionality, we can determine specific things such as the web traffic attribution of a site, or create usage funnels.
Another important tool that data analysts use is a programming language, such as R or Python, or usually both. These languages are used to perform more specific calculations used in statistics, or to create visualizations in the form of graphs and charts.

 patriot1959:

Why can I not use the declared global variable in different scripts?


That should not be a problem on the same page since all JS shares the same namespace for a given document. Crossing into another namespace seems a bit far-fetched. There would be the need of an intermediary to bridge the gap. Query strings comes to mind.

You’ve only shown a third of your code (can’t reproduce)

yes, i will try the query string… Thanks
it seams a global var isn’t so global. Or is there a way to import a function in JS and than use the dot  notation (like in python for example)?




 patriot1959:

it seams a global var isn’t so global


You’re doing a lot more than just that, you can quickly show that they are global by doing that and only that

Hmmm… ok.  I would really appreciate it if you can show me  (point me in the right direction) how to handle it in JavaScript. I was ‘battling’ with that topic now for over a week and could not figure it out. What I’m looking for is how I can use a var or a result/ return of a function from script1.js  in script2.js in combination with html (DOM). I’m relatively new to JS and probably thinking to much in the way like Python is, what I’m pretty familiar with. Thank you!!

In terms of global variables there’s no issue there
<script>a = 4</script>
<script>console.log(a)  // writes 4 to console</script>

So what’s really going on is probably that one of your assumptions aren’t holding up (you’re testing a lot of things all at once, and then deciding which is responsible, but it could be other things. need to test these things in isolation from each other)
For all I know, you do this:
<script>console.log(a)  // a doesn't exist</script>
<script>a = 4</script>

I don’t know what the problem is. If a bug can’t be reproduced then it doesn’t exist, right?

…understand, I will check the order and than isolate ever single step.
I did assume that I can import a script like a module and use dot notation to use ta function from another script. That was whatI was searching, but couldn’t find. I need to rethink and start over in small steps like you said

I know very little of how things are done on the web, I mostly assume it’s a bunch of ugly hacks that I don’t want to know anything about.
You can certainly emulate modules. One way to go about it is to have each module be a function which returns an object with exports (I believe this is what nodejs does)
You could then either have a central import system so that each module is imported only once with guarantees of no cycles and all such things, or call the modules to obtain an instance of their exports. Doing that yourself would work in small scale, but so would global variables so it’s not exactly solving that problem, it will in particular not solve your bug because we already established that global variables are accessible between scripts. I imagine there exists libraries for doing this.
function module1() {
  function f(){}
  function g(){exports.x = 7}
  ...
  let exports = {f, g}
  return exports
}


Thank you, I will that way, but definitely  start with breaking it down and isolate.

In literal terms, it is a boundary between objects, such the interface of water and air, water and ice, ice and air. Not only is there a physical boundary, but a layer that separates each object from the boundary.
For instance when ocean water freezes, the ice is separated from the salt water by a layer of fresh (salt-free) water. LIkewise between water and air, or ice and air there is a layer of water vapor.
In computing, we use API’s and drivers to communicate across the boundary that separates two components. An ethernet card is a network interface that permits computers on any platform to communicate with each other at distance. Same applies to line printers, modems and other peripheral devices.

403,Why should we care about manual testing when we have automated tests?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
We discuss manual testing here. The actions are repetitive and mechanical so it seems that this is a strong candidate for automation. What is the value to manually testing?
Answer
When we’re testing a piece of software (anything really) we’re basing our analyses off of a specification, spec for short, of the expected behavior. Some initial manual testing based on the spec is helpful in focusing the types of automated tests we would like to perform and can highlight other aspects of the software that should be explored in automated tests which are not explicitly stated in the spec. This happens fairly often. Furthermore, once automated tests are in place, manual testing is helpful when exploring a failed automated test more carefully.

Question
In this exercise, we’re encouraged to find as many bugs as we can. Are there systematic recommendations for finding these bugs?
Answer
In this case, we’re working with a website where we have some intuition for what it does:

The name should show up at the bottom of the page.
The cake type should appear.
Each of the fillings should appear.
And finally, the size of the stack should appear.

With these simple rules of thumb in mind, we can begin to experiment with the site by including some fields, excluding others, and including multiple responses per field, if possible; multiple fillings for example.
This is a general course of action: We first make the expected behaviors of the application explicit and then push the boundaries of these behaviors in different combinations.

There’s a lot of problems, Here is one to figure out that has no relation to code: How will you store 360 photos. 5 minutes of 360 video at a trash bitrate of 20mbps is 0.7 gigabytes. Most Instagram videos are as low as 20-100megabytes. Figuring out a way to compress/store/deliver the content of said size in an efficient manner would be very hard.

What you could do that would have a greater chance of success is to build an API that someone like Facebook or Snapchat would want to buy. There are a lot of problems with the current technology. Although this would require Electrical Engineers and other industry professionals.

410,Interfaces in Web API,"Get Help,General Programming",,2,"
There are interfaces in the Web API. What are interfaces?
","
In a interface you define certain functionality that an object that implements this interface MUST have. It is important to note that you don’t use any logic in an interface.
Every object that implements an interface promises that it has the function that has been defined in the interface.
here is a very nice example i pulled from stackoverflow:

Suppose you want to hire a plumber to fix some things on your house, you don’t know (and you don’t care much) who you may end up hiring but you know what the plumber must be able to do. So, you define a set of tasks that anyone that claims to be a plumber must know how to do. Of course everybody might have its own way of carrying out each task, but in the end, the person you are hiring is a plumber because they know how to do each task.

So what you want to use an interface for is to define what an object should be capable of(i.e. fix leak) without defining how this object should do it (because you don’t care as long as its done).

411,Is there a set process when performing data science?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, is there a set process of steps when performing data science?
Answer
Yes, this process is known as the Data Science Process. You will learn more about this process in a later lesson, and a summary of the steps in the process are as follows.
The first step is asking a question, where the aim is to discover what the scientific goal is, and what you are trying to predict or estimate.
Next is determining the necessary data, where we figure out what sample size is needed, and what data we actually need to prove or refute the initial hypothesis.
After this is getting the data, during which we discover things such as how the data was sampled, which of the data is relevant and whether there are privacy issues.
The next step is cleaning and organizing the data, where we determine if the data is readable, and also get rid of unnecessary values such as outliers.
Next, we explore the data, during which we plot the data, and check things such as where there are anomalies or patterns that might be important.
Next is modeling the data which includes building, fitting and then validating the accuracy of the model.
And last, but not least, is communicating your findings, where we share what we learned, determine if the results made sense and if we can tell a story from the data.

412,When do we apply supervised or unsupervised learning?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, when do we apply supervised or unsupervised learning?
Answer
Supervised learning would apply when the given data has already been labeled and categorized, and we are trying to determine and predict new data points based on this data. Supervised learning usually applies to problems involving predictions based on trends or patterns, which are usually linear.
For instance, supervised learning would apply when trying to predict housing prices based on square footage. We may visualize the data on a 2D graph, where the price increases linearly in relation to the square footage. Following the line of best fit to this graph, we can predict unknown prices.
Unsupervised learning would be applied when the data provided is unlabeled, and we do not know exactly what they are. Unsupervised learning attempts to figure out the inherent structure of the data, by grouping the similar data together, and then categorizing these groups or “clusters”.
For an example, say that we had images of animals, but are not given the labels for what animals are in the images. You might imagine that these are of completely new species. Since we do not know what they are pictures of, we would group together ones that share similar physical characters, then label these groups.

JavaScript's strict mode, introduced in ECMAScript 5, is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of ""sloppy mode"". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal...

if i compare your document ready:

it looks different, do you know what document ready does?

but i didn’t see you reply at my question, did i miss it?

I have downloaded this https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/ and then I attached the typed.min.js into my html and then I typed that code on the main.js
I am not so familiar with jQuery I know it is something, some type of a library. I believe that I did the attachings correct and everything is in place.
I mainly dont understand why it says typed is not a function. It has to be !

no, line 2 of jquery.min.js? Given that is the error line, which you can clearly see in the console error

where is line 2 of jquery.min.js
I have already sent the image of the console error at the top of this page.

Some other people seem to have the same problem. The reason is that Typed.js is no longer a jquery plugin. this means you can’t call those function in a jquery context.

415,How can outliers affect the classifications?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how can outliers affect the classifications?
Answer
Outliers can affect the classifications in a negative way, because of the sensitivity of K-Nearest Neighbors to them.
As explained in the exercise text, even a single outlier can cause problems if the value of k is very small, like k=1, because any point near the outlier will be more influenced by it.
One reason why outliers are so impactful is that the K-Nearest Neighbors technique is completely dependent upon the input data. Outliers in the input data can impact the boundaries of classification because points that fall near to them can be classified differently than expected.
To avoid these issues caused by outliers, it can be a good idea to try and remove them initially. Another thing you can do is choose higher values of k, larger than 1, but not too large, because this can cause underfitting. By choosing a good value of k, it can still remain accurate even despite possible outliers, because it will not only take into account the outlier, but also the surrounding neighbor points.
",
416,Can we have certain dimensions have more significance than others?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this exercise, each dimension contributes equally to the classification of a point. Can we have certain dimensions have more significance, or contribute more, than others?
Answer
Yes, this is possible. To do this, you can use a variation of K-Nearest Neighbors, known as Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors. The idea is that when calculating the distance to each point, we can set constants that will multiply with each dimension’s value differently.
This post will not go into depth on the methods of calculation, which can be implemented on your own, but the way that it works will be shown in the following example.
In this example, we have k = 3, such that a random point will be classified to whatever the majority of the 3 nearest neighbor points classify as. This image shows the original K-Nearest Neighbors classification without weights. It is classified as green because there are 2 diamonds and 1 star for its 3 nearest neighbors.

By introducing weights in the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors variation, we could end up with something different. In the following graph, each point has a weight calculated based on the importance of each dimension, where each dimension does not contribute equally. Although there are 2 diamonds and 1 star in the 3 nearest neighbors, the greatest weight is toward the yellow classification.

",
417,What happens if there are outliers?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, what happens if there are outliers?
Answer
Outliers can happen in reality and are not always avoidable. In addition, unless there is a very good reason to remove them, outliers cannot be easily excluded from real-world data.
As a result, outliers can appear somewhat frequently in datasets. When there are outliers, they can have a fairly strong influence on the slope and intercept of the dataset. As a consequence, the line of best fit for the data can be slightly off, or possibly even completely wrong.

418,Why does an overly large learning rate cause the graph to diverge?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why does an overly large learning rate cause the graph to diverge?
Answer
In the graph shown in the exercise, it shows what can happen when the learning rate is too large, causing a zig-zag-like pattern of divergence due to constantly overshooting the minimum.
When the function overshoots the minimum, it will attempt to make changes to the parameters to compensate, and will move in the opposite direction as the previous step, towards the minimum. A large learning rate can cause these changes to be drastic and the function will recompute values that are larger and larger than the previous steps. This will continue and result in the zig-zag-like pattern of divergence up the graph.
",
419,What is a step?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what is a step?
Answer
A step is essentially an update of parameter values, with the aim of decreasing the loss and moving in the direction of the local minimum.
Steps do not only have to increase the parameter value but can also decrease its value. A “step size” determines how big of a change we make to the parameters each step.
For example, as illustrated in this animation from exercise 5, the update of the b value from 10 to 12 can be considered a step.

425,Why is it helpful to visualize data?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, why is it helpful to visualize data?
Answer
There are some important reasons why it is helpful to visualize data. One is that it allows you to communicate the data more clearly to others. By showing a visual representation of the data, it is much easier to understand than if you were just showing the pure data itself.
In addition, visualizing data lets us see and identify patterns and trends in the data, that might not have been apparent without seeing a visual representation. Graphs can show peaks, valleys, curves, spikes, and other shapes or trends of the data that can help us understand the behavior and qualities of data.
As the saying goes, a picture, in this case, a visualization, can be worth a thousand words.
",
426,When do we use each type of graph shown?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, when do we use each type of graph shown?
Answer
Depending on what you are trying to convey visually with data, certain graphs can be better suited for the task. The following are brief summaries of each graph and when you might apply them.
A bar chart with error has the qualities of a bar chart, which lets us see categorical data. The heights of each bar can represent the average of values in the category, and with the addition of error bars, we can see the range of all values from smallest to largest represented by the bottom and top lines of the error bar. You might use this to display the average grade of students categorized by college major.
A line chart with error has the qualities of a line chart, which lets us display values for a sequence of data points, connected with straight lines. The added shaded error lets us see a lower and upper bound that the values can fall between, similar to the bar chart with error. You might use this to show stock prices over time.
Histograms let us see frequencies of variables that fall within intervals, which we refer to as “bins”. The one displayed in this exercise is a specific type called a normalized histogram, such that the total area of all the rectangles in the histogram sum to 1. You might use histograms to show how many people there are within different age ranges in years, like 10-20, 20-30, and so on.
A pie chart lets us see how values contribute to a whole, like slices of a pie. Each wedge size is proportional to the fraction of each value of the total value. You might use a pie chart when showing the percentages of students in different college majors.
Side by side charts are bar charts where different sets of data are shown next to each other. This is useful to directly visualize and compare multiple sets of data with each other. You might use this to compare the average grades of students based on college major from different colleges.
Last, but not least, stacked bars allow us to see how individual values contribute toward a total value, similar to pie charts, but displayed as a vertical column and without the restriction of a set size, as you can keep adding to the bar’s total height. You might use stacked bars when showing the hours spent studying for different classes per day. The total height of each column would be total hours spent studying that day.

427,Is K-Nearest Neighbors similar to K-Means Clustering?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this lesson, we learned about the K-Nearest Neighbors classification technique. However, is K-Nearest Neighbors similar to K-Means Clustering?
Answer
No, although their names are somewhat similar, they are conceptually quite different methods of machine learning. Some important differences are as follows.
K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm where K describes the number of neighbor points that we look at for each data point to determine its classification. As a supervised algorithm, we have the labels of the data points, and use those to predict the labels of new data points.
In addition, the concept behind this algorithm is that for a point, it will get its K nearest neighbors, based on the closest distance. And, this algorithm only really has to iterate one time through, unlike K-Means Clustering which iterates multiple times until convergence is reached.
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm, where the K is used to describe how many centroids or clusters there will be when applying the algorithm. As an unsupervised algorithm, we are not given any labels, but instead, we have parameters that we use to group similar data points together and find the clusters.
The concept behind this algorithm is that we try to calculate the locations of the K centers, or the averages or means, of the data points, which are where the clusters are most likely centered on. It will recalculate the centers based on the data points, and will iterate multiple times until convergence is reached, which happens when the newly computed center locations stop changing.

428,Does the graph of k always follow this shape?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, does the graph of k for any dataset follow this shape?
Answer
In general, yes, any dataset should follow a similar shape as the one shown, although it may appear slightly different.

k.png1280×960 76.2 KB

The general trend that is shown in a k vs validation accuracy graph will be as follows.
For small values of k, the accuracy will be low, because the model will overfit the data.
As k increases, accuracy will also increase, until eventually reaching a sort of “hump” shape, where the best value of k will be between. In this particular graph, this happens around the value k=74, where the validation accuracy is highest.
After this “hump”, the accuracy will continue to drop, as k increases further, and underfitting occurs due to high k values.

429,What are some other examples of real data that linear regression can apply to?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what are some other examples of real data that linear regression can apply to?
Answer
In general, linear regression can apply to datasets for which there is a linear relationship between two variables.
One common example is housing price data vs a single parameter of the house, such as the number of rooms, square footage, and so on. Another example can be the household income vs the education level of the house owners. Linear regression can also apply to datasets that have the time, in hours, studied vs the grade received for an exam. Also, we can apply linear regression on data showing the number of transistors in a computer chip vs time in years, which is known as Moore’s law.
In addition to these, there are countless real-world datasets that linear regression can apply to, so feel free to find them and test out your linear regression models on!

You’d have to compare to something else in order to be able to say that there’s a difference.
If there’s software involved in rendering your font, that may be different.
Or maybe you’re just using a different font.
If “the editor” refers to a website, then that website might or might not provide a font and might have logic for selecting one. And/or your browser may be using its own fonts (and, again, whatever is rendering them plays a part, and is something you’d change in your os)

When I say editor I mean the codecademy editor, thanks for the reply

I would like to know where I would go to change the font of the text editor within codecademy if possible.

Hmmm, why not use inspect element, and replace this:
.aclass {
    font-family: monospace;
}

To this:
.aclass {
    font-family: “which ever one you prefer”;
}

Replace ”which ever one you prefer with a valid font, though. 

I don’t know about yours but on my end it changes when I change my browser’s fonts

It’s because Windows/macOS and Linux have different stock fonts. A lot of fonts that Windows has have no font that is similar in Linux.
Here’s a table to show just a few examples.

434,Is it possible to avoid ties entirely?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this exercise, it explains that ties can occur in the classifications. Is it possible to avoid ties entirely?
Answer
No, unfortunately, ties cannot be avoided entirely. To account for this fact, we implement ways to “break” a tie, like choosing one at random or several other methods.
In very few specific cases, they might be avoidable. For instance, for the movie classification, there are only two classifications: “good” or “bad”. If we choose an odd value for k, then ties will never occur, since it cannot have exactly half “good” and half “bad” neighbors. One will have an odd number and the other, an even number, never causing a tie.
In general, for more than two classifications of a dataset, ties are almost impossible to avoid entirely. For example, say that there are three classifications: “A”, “B”, or “C”. No matter what value of k, greater than 1, that we choose, ties can happen. If we choose an even k, like 8, then it might end up as
[""A"", ""A"", ""A"", ""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B""]
with a tie between “A” and “B”.
Or, if we choose an odd k, say 7, then it might end up as
[""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""B"", ""C"", ""C"", ""C""]
As you can see, we still get a tie, but this time with “B” and “C”.

435,What if the minimum and maximum values are the same?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
This exercise explained how we could use min-max normalization so that different features are weighed similarly. What happens if the minimum and maximum for some feature are the same?
Answer
It is unlikely, but possible, that the minimum and maximum values for some feature are the same value. In that case, our calculation for normalization would fail, due to division by zero.
(value-minimum) / (maximum-minimum)

To account for this possibility, one thing you can do is skip the calculation, and instead set all the values of that feature to the same value, say 0 or 1, for each data point. This way, they will all be weighed the same.
However, we may determine that when all values are the same, then this does not provide any useful information to us. So, we might also consider excluding that feature entirely. For example, say that we had a dataset for animal physical features and that every animal in our dataset had two legs. Since we know that each animal has two legs, then we might exclude that feature in our calculations.

436,Are features limited to certain types?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this exercise, it introduced some features of a movie dataset that were of type integer and boolean. Are features limited to certain types like numbers or boolean?
Answer
No, features can essentially be any type, such as integers, booleans, and even string values. For instance, another feature that is added to the movies dataset might be the movie titles, which would be string values.
When choosing features, however, it is important that there is a way to compare them and determine how similar they are, preferably in a quantifiable way. If you are including string values as a feature, then you may need to implement a way to find out how similar two string values are, so that the result is quantifiable. You might do this by finding the difference of the character values for two strings, counting how many characters two strings have in common, or some other method.

First of all, Codecademy used Python 2, and helped you learn from that, but the latest update of Python is 3.7.1, as @trevorhodges said.
And yes, 5 + 5 is 10, as an odd number added to another odd number results in an even number, as @mtf stated. 7 + 7 = 14, 9 + 9 = 18, 11 + 11 = 22, 13– well I think you get it now

Hey Zefy, welcome to the forums.
I would suggest you try clicking on each of the buttons and their options. Or, simply go to the Visual Studio documentations:


docs.microsoft.com



Visual Studio Documentation - Visual Studio
Learn how to use Visual Studio 2017 to develop applications, services, and tools in the language of your choice, for your platforms and devices.






Thanks for the reply _markviii.
I have tried mutilple things. Searched through the documentations and googled it a LOT.
A few tech geek friends looked it up. They didn’t seem to find what to do.
I was hoping for some more specific advice cause nothing seems to work  :’)

You know what, Zefy?
If you’re really willing to clean your terminal, then just close Visual Studio, and open it again. I can’t think of anything else but that.
You’re welcome 

I obviously cannot close and open the program every single time I run my code …
I need a way to make it skip recalling the full FilePath every time F5 is pressed.
Thanks for your help.

What makes it hard to read? Your program starts under the blue stuff doesn’t it?
Perhaps your program would like to print a bunch of blank lines before it does anything else.
Or maybe you could edit your F5 binding so that it also runs clear or maybe a program of your own making which prints empty lines.
If you’re trying to run your program multiple times without any output between them at all, then you could write a program which repeatedly runs a command each time it’s told to do so. That’s not entirely trivial though, because you’d have to tell it to restart…without telling it through the terminal (would have to go via network or file system or other shared memory…and you’d probably want it to run at the same time as your own program so now we’re talking about concurrency as well)…That’s probably similar to what that command is itself doing by the way, in order to send text to your output tab. But is the problem really big enough to care that much? You probably can’t do it yourself, and whoever makes the python plugins you’re using might (rightly) think a narrow-use-case feature like F5 isn’t worth it, or that this isn’t at all how it should behave, or that there’s some fundamental problem with the idea.
Have you considered running the program yourself from the terminal, maybe in a separate window because your editor doesn’t really need to be involved does it? Because this is exactly the kind of thing that a terminal is for.
I imagine pycharm has this better figured out. But that has other problems, like one whole editor for just one language, and that it inserts itself into your program for debugging purposes and such in ways that might cause you more trouble than it’s worth because you don’t know how it does that and if you did you could do it yourself without the middle man.
So, no I’m not suggesting pycharm. Rather I am suggesting that you treat your editor and your program as separate things!

There are programs that can monitor file updates.
One is the ruby gem guard, and it has a plugin guard-process which could be used here.
A big bonus is that it’s not tied to any editor or such, it’s much more flexible than that.

No clue if it works on windows. It just might. You might need to learn a whole bunch to even install it, it’s not exactly a typical windows app with a graphical installer.

440,What are some other examples of clustering applications?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, what are some other examples of clustering applications?
Answer
Generally, clustering applies when we want to separate and group data based on similar features.
Clustering can also apply to applications that match people together, such as dating sites, or services to connect professionals, which can utilize clustering to determine recommended connections.
Clustering can also apply to personality tests, like the Myers Briggs personality test, which take certain responses and group you into a certain category based on those responses.
In addition, clustering can also apply when grouping organisms based on their physical traits, such that if you provide information, say for a dog, it should categorize it as that kind of animal.

441,How is inertia calculated?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, how is inertia calculated?
Answer
According to the documentation for the KMeans method, the inertia_ attribute is the sum of squared distances of the samples to their nearest centroids.
So, to obtain the value of the inertia, we would obtain each data points’ distance to its nearest centroid, square this distance, and then sum them all together, which gives us the inertia. We will utilize the Euclidean, or geometric, distance formula to calculate this.
The following is a general overview of how we might calculate the inertia.
inertia = 0

for datapoint in dataset:
  # Obtain the nearest centroid of the point.
  centroid = get_centroid(datapoint)

  # Calculate the distance from each datapoint to its centroid
  # using the Euclidean distance formula.
  delta_x = datapoint.x - centroid.x
  delta_y = datapoint.y - centroid.y
  distance = (delta_x ** 2 + delta_y ** 2) ** 0.5

  # Square the distance, and add to the inertia.
  squared_distance = distance ** 2
  inertia += squared_distance

442,Does feeding new data when running predict() update the predictor?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, does feeding new data when running predict() update the predictor?
Answer
No, when we feed in new data samples using the predict() method of our KMeans model, the predictor does not get changed or updated.
When running the predict() method, it will return its best guess, based on what it learned in the previous steps. When we pass in the new data samples and obtain its predictions, we do not explicitly tell the predictor whether its guess was correct or not, so there is no way for it to update itself based on its guesses. Once it has been fitted to its sample test data, it will not be able to update itself to new data, unless we redo the fitting process.

443,What other unsupervised learning techniques are there?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this lesson, what other unsupervised learning techniques are there?
Answer
In addition to clustering, there are several other techniques that can be used for unsupervised learning.
Artificial neural networks is another technique for performing unsupervised learning. This technique is inspired by the neural networks in real brains, like the ones that humans or animals have. These typically comprise of a graph-like interconnection of nodes, which represent neurons, that takes in input values, perform calculations along each connection, then produces some output values at the end.
Latent variable models are another technique used for unsupervised learning, which is a model that makes inferences based on some observable variables. This model can include a few different algorithms and approaches, such as principal component analysis and singular value decomposition.
One other technique for unsupervised learning is anomaly detection, which is used to find anomalies, or unexpected patterns or behaviors, in the datasets which differ greatly from the rest of the data.

444,How can we expand Bayes spam filtering to multiple key words?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the lesson on spam filtering using Bayes’ theorem, we’re asked to determine whether or not an email should be classified as spam given that it contains the word enhancement. In real world scenarios we can’t make a good decision based only on one word. How can we expand this approach to multiple words?
Answer
Recall that in writing P(A|B), A and B are just events. So, simply, they can be more complex than just a single word. If we want to make this Bayes spam filter more realistic, we can look at each of the words w1, w2, ... ,wn in the email and consider

P(spam | w1, w2, ... , wn)

the probability that the email is spam given all the words in the email under consideration. It may look a bit more involved but the ways that we compute the probabilities are not much more complicated; B just happens to equal w1, w2, ..., wn:

P(w1, w2, ... , wn) is the probability that each of these words appear in any email
P(w1, w2, ... , wn | spam) is the probability that a spam email contains each of these words

445,How do bigram and triam models improve naive Bayes?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the final lesson for the naive Bayes classifier, it is suggested that using a bigram or trigram model makes the assumption of independence more reasonable. Please expand on this?
Answer
Recall that the key assumption of this model, the assumption that makes it “naive”, is the assumption that the words in a sentence are independent. What does this mean? This means that given any word in a sentence, we have no idea what the following word will be. This is clearly unrealistic. Language has a structure and so there’s a good chance that you can predict the word following some arbitrary string of words and can also choose the small set of words that follow some arbitrary word. We can see this in our auto-completing texts and emails.
So our assumption of independence on a word by word basis is a pretty bad assumption although it works well in many applications. Bigrams and trigrams give us an easy way to make this independence assumption a little more likely with little effort since there’s more variation in strings than single words.
So if our sentence is “This crib is great”, our original assumption was that these words were independent

“This”, “crib”, “is”, and “great”

For the bigram, we assume that these strings are independent

“This crib”, “crib is”, and “is great”.

and for the trigram we assume independence of

“This crib is” and “crib is great”

446,Can we always ignore the denominator in our computation of the naive Bayes classifier?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In this exercise about computing the denominator for the naive Bayes classifier, it is noted that we can ignore the denominator since we’re comparing P(positive | review) and P(negative | review) and so can cancel out their denominators to simplify our work. When would we make use of the denominator?
Answer
Recall that P(review) = ""chance that a review only contains the words in review"". With that in mind, we can notice that this value can tell us something about our data set. Maybe if this probability is very low, the chance that the review will be misclassified is high and vice versa, if this probability is high, the chance of misclassification is low. In comparing the probabilities for the class labels, P(positive | review) vs. P(negative | review) in our case, however, the denominators are the same and so we can cancel them to simplify our computation.

447,Explaining the terms within Bayes' theorem for the naive Bayes classifier,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
With the naive Bayes classifier, we are finding the probability that a data point d is a member of a class C using Bayes’ theorem: P(C|d) = P(C)*P(d|C) / P(d). We can determine P(C) because this model is supervised and we have data. But what is P(d)? How do we find the probability of a data point?
Answer
Because we’re using naive Bayes to classify text documents, for example reviews, let’s consider what P(""I love this product!"") means. Since naive Bayes is supervised, we have a database of correctly classified reviews that we want to check “I love this product!” against. The probability P(""I love this product!"") is giving us the chances that the review is already in the database. For instance, we may already have reviews which are very similar to this review. This value can give us a hint as to the accuracy of our classification.

448,Can we apply specific colors to our clusters?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, we apply colors to the points by setting c=labels in the plt.scatter() method call. Can we apply specific colors to our clusters?
Answer
Yes, you can!
To specify colors for each cluster, you can assign a color to each point individually, depending on what their label was. We can do this by creating a new list, iterating over each data point’s label, and then adding the color to the list based on that label.
In the following example, we set colors, as string values, to each point based on their label, “red” for label 0, “blue” for label 1, and “green” for label 2.
# Create the empty list
colors = []

# Iterate over each label, and 
# assign the color based on the label
for label in labels:
  if label == 0:
    colors.append(""red"")
  elif label == 1:
    colors.append(""blue"")
  elif label == 2:
    colors.append(""green"")

# Plot the scatter plot using this list for the colors
plt.scatter(x, y, c=colors, alpha=0.5)

449,How is the average of points calculated?,"Get Help,General Programming",,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, describing step 3 of K-Means clustering, how is the average of points calculated?
Answer
In this exercise, we utilize the np.mean() function to calculate the average of data points.
What this will do is average each dimension (x, y, z, …) of the points individually, and then those averages will determine the average of those points.
For example, say that we had the 2-dimensional points
[[0, 3],
 [2, 5],
 [4, 7]]

The average of these points would then be obtained by averaging each dimension individually,
x = (0 + 2 + 4) / 3 = 2
y = (3 + 5 + 7) / 3 = 5

The average of the points will then be [2, 5].
